# ðŸŽ‰**Welcome to AIMon Rely**

AIMon Rely is a state-of-the-art system consisting of multiple models for detecting LLM quality issues during offline evaluations and continuous production monitoring. We offer
hallucination metrics that is fast, reliable and cost-effective. We also support additional metrics such as
completeness, conciseness and toxicity. 

Read our [blog post](https://aimon.ai/blogs/introducing-rely) for more details.

## Metrics Supported

These are the quality metrics that are currently available via the API. Some of them are in progress and will be
available in a future release.

## API

Steps to use the API:

- Step 1: Get your API key by requesting it on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/generativeair/shared_invite/zt-2jab62lsj-xM9a_s~Qweu8lf3YS2cANg) or sending an email
  to info@aimon.ai
- Step 2: You can try the API using either of these methods
    - [OPTION 1] Try the simple langchain summarization application that is augmented with AIMon Rely to detect
      hallucinations at the sentence level.
        - Step 1: Run `pip install -r examples/requirements.txt && pip install aimon`
        - Step 2: Run `streamlit run examples/langchain_summarization_app.py`
    - [OPTION 2] Download the Postman collection specified below to access the API
        - Model Hallucination (Passage and Sentence
          Level): [Postman Collection](examples/postman_collections)

### Sandbox

You can play with a [Sandbox](https://aimon.ai/tryproduct) that is available on our website.

## Benchmarks

### Hallucination Detection
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we benchmarked it against popular industry benchmarks for the
hallucination detection task. The table below shows our results.

A few key takeaways:

âœ… AIMon Rely is **10x cheaper** than GPT-4 Turbo.

âœ… AIMon Rely is **4x faster** than GPT-4 Turbo.

âœ… AIMon Rely provides the convenience of a fully hosted API that includes baked-in explainability.

âœ… Support for a context length of up to 32,000 tokens (with plans to further expand this in the near future).

Overall, AIMon Rely is 10 times cheaper, 4 times faster and close to or even **better than GPT-4** on the benchmarks
making it a suitable choice for both offline and online detection of hallucinations.

### Completeness, Conciseness Detection

There is a lack of industry standard benchmark datasets for these metrics. We will be publishing an evaluation dataset soon.

## Future Work

- We are working on additional metrics as detailed in the table above.
- In addition, we are working on something awesome to make the offline evaluation and continuous model quality
  monitoring experience more seamless.
