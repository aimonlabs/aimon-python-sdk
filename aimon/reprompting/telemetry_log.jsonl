In connection with this project, the committee recommends that the bill passes, amended with the Divided report with councilmembers Burgess, Herbold, Johnson and O'Brien favoring councilmembers. So want a post from Burgess? Thank you. First of all, I want to start by giving a little history of of this project, which is directly across the street, across Fourth Avenue, where the old public safety headquarters building used to stand. None of us on the city council today or the mayor were involved when the city made a decision in 2007 to allow development of that site, including a civic square plaza. In 2007, when that decision was made. That followed a ten year process where the city engaged with a variety of developers and finally came up with the proposal that was won by Triad development. Due to the Great Recession and other issues, Triad has been unable to develop the project. The city has, since Triad failed, has been involved with four different attempts to find someone who could develop the project. And Bowser Development is the organization that has advanced the proposal that we will consider today. This legislation, if adopted, allows the director of FASB to execute an amended and restated purpose and sale development agreement with Bowser Development. The property formerly known as the Public Safety Building BLOCK. Bowser will construct a single tower residential project on the property, as well as a 25,000 square foot public plaza which the city has the right to approve the design of. Bowser will pay the city $16 million in sale proceeds, which will go to our Equitable Development Initiative. Bowser will pay the city a minimum of $5.7 million for affordable housing. The final amount of this affordable housing payment will be determined once the final design of the residential tower is complete. The project also calls for continuous operation of the Pioneer Square Transit Tunnel Station, which is located beneath this block. The total consideration for the city to receive here is approximately $50 million $16 million in sale proceeds. The minimum contribution of $5.7 million in affordable housing. The release of liability of the city, and the waiver of potential litigation costs. An immediate maintenance requirement. Once this ordinance is adopted by the Council, Bowser will take immediate control and will begin doing maintenance on the walls of the pit across the street. Some of that maintenance is needed almost immediately. The committee recommends that this legislation be adopted. Thank you very much. We want to highlight that there is no intention to shut down the product line. Comments, concerns or questions? Councilmember Johnson just. Wanted to offer a couple of quick things. One of the things that I think was important in my consideration of voting for this is that we also have a project labor agreement. That's one of the conditions of the proposed term and sale and that that project labor agreement has already been sent after. Washington, D.C. was a really great sign for us. The developer has a track record here in Seattle but is still relatively new to the city. So working proactively with our building construction trades to develop a project labor agreement that will bring more apprentices and more individuals to the construction trades, I think is going to be really critical here. That $5.7 million floor that Councilmember Burgess talked about would build at minimum 70 units of affordable housing here in the city and will be larger if it's found that the floor plates for the tower is larger than what was originally proposed by the previous developer. So good options here for us and really looking forward to the final action here this afternoon. Thanks very much for the comments. I'm going to ask the clerk, please call the roll on that. I'm sorry, Councilmember Swan. Thank you, President Herrell. I voted against this council bill in committee and I intend to do so again today. And I would like to take a moment to explain why this vote authorizes the sale of an extremely valuable city property to a big developer for $16 million, which I think would be an estimated at least an estimated $40 million less than its actual value. This sweetheart deal for Seattle's mega developers is nothing new, really. As was mentioned accurately, this property has been sitting idle for the past n\", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to. And worse yet, the public doesn't know what we're talking about or any background to this either. So that's at least an item I'd like to reserve to discuss whether, since we're all members of the City Council, that if we want to have something considered, we should at least have to go through the council referral process. But I know Vice Mayor matters. You want to speak on the Open House proposal? I actually have a similar concern. Is that. We don't have any detail on. On that and are we going to discuss detail and refer it on? That was my question. So so. Okay. Because because one of the concerns I have is are our agendas with the lists, \"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat is the purpose of the proposed legislation regarding the former Public Safety Building block?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Item number six, please. Communication from Council on Mango Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilman super novice Mary Andrews recommendation to discuss and enact related strategic planning initiatives with youth sports leagues in preparation for re-opening our parks to youth sports activities. Thank you. I appreciate everyone who signed on to this item. As many know, our youth sports programs are many nonprofit organizations and some are many businesses. They employ people who are coaches or referees, and they also have many, many volunteers and parents that participate in keeping the kids out and about and engaged in athletics, which keeps them healthy and strong. So we need to have a focus on ensuring that we are prepared to take on the challenge ahead of allowing multiple sports who are typically spread over a year to really prepare to come back and potentially play simultaneously. An example of this is some of our sports fields overlap each other and we wouldn't be able to in some facilities throughout the city, host both soccer and baseball at the same time. But there are adjustments that can be made throughout the city to make those types of things possible. So when and if sports can come back, we are prepared to give all youth the opportunity to get out there and practice their skills so as they move through and participate in their school sports, they have those knowledge, skills and abilities and talents to really help them through and keep them engaged in their schoolwork. So I really appreciate the youth sports directors that have reached out with you on better understanding your goals. And I think it's important to have a formal process where Parks and Rec really sits with the directors and casting directors that know and understand the complexities that can come about as we roll out the new requirements, which organizations are really prepared to do to meet that challenge and for them to be able to share ideas with people that aren't yet getting that kind of guidance from their national association? Councilman Supernormal. Thank you. And if that was the motion, I'd like to second the motion and just add to it that I fully support this and thank Councilmember Mongo for bringing it forward. We have the good fortune of having some baseball leagues in the fourth district, Durant Park Post, Long Beach League, Whaley Post, Long Beach Pro Baseball, and then where the North has a number of volleyball teams. Our council district has invested a lot into these facilities. We support them tremendously, and we'd really like to see them get going once again. Also to reiterate what Councilman Mungo stated, and that is these organizations can bring their own protocols to the table. So let's make sure we we listen to them as we move forward. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you so much. I appreciate I appreciate bringing this item forward. And I have kids who are in their youth programs in the city, both the city sponsored ones and also club ones. And I really do think we need to sit down and figure out how to work on protocols that make participation in these activities safe and feasible for our youth. I can say that as a parent of two children who have been out of school now for since March and entering into the summer, there is a lot of downtime for them. And I think team sports and sports activities that we're able to reintegrate into our daily lives will assist them tremendously in getting outdoors, exercising, staying healthy, making good choices, interacting with people outside of the technology world that they're most of them are operating in. And so anything that we can do as a city to help partner with these organizations to allow for safe reopening and participation, I would support and I appreciate Cassell and Mongo bringing this item forward. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Austin. Thank you. I just want to add my my my support to this item. Obviously, youth sports are extremely important and I really think it's part of the DNA of this city. So when we get back to functionality, we should have a plan to ensure that that our youth are safe, their parents are safe, and that they are having an enriched activity, whatever sport they are playing, either super active sports or not. And so I think there are also a lot of national organizations that are connected to many of these sports organizations that they can draw upon information as well. Our staff can draw upon information as well. But I do like the idea of working with local youth organizations, sports organizations throughout the city to to be engaged in the process, at least as as important stakeholders in the process. So congratulations. I really like this item and plan on supporting it. Council member Adam Quirk. Any public comment? Yes. We do have public comment on this item. Joel Davis. Um, you have 3 minutes. I may regret not to thank you for hearing this agenda item and allow it. My name is Joel. There's a current president o\", \"One, two. We're going to move on to our our our first our study session that we have scheduled tonight, which is actually a pretty important one. And so I just want to just give everyone just a minute to kind of a shake off their tiredness as we go into it here. But we're going to go we're going to go right into this first and then into the study session, and we'll then we'll continue the rest of the agenda. So our staff are going to give you I'll give you guys a minute to get set up. We can please load the presentation. The team. Carrie. Ready to go? Okay. Let me let me just make a couple opening remarks and we'll get right into it. Just I want to say that this is I know going to be, I believe, part one of a of a two part major presentation on ah, the state of our streets and the payment management plan that this council has been working very hard on ensuring that we implement. There has been a lot of excitement around infrastructure. I also want to add that the city is and has embarked on its largest infrastructure plan and street plan that we've had in probably 40 or 50 years. And so the amount of dollars that are going into our streets over the course of the next decade is significant. It's it's, of course, thanks in large part to the support of the voters with measure. It's also because of legislation that's gone that's come down the pipeline that's increasing our ability to to improve local streets. And so we are we're grateful that we're also grateful that Measure M, which was also passed by the voters, also adds to this to this pot. And so it's a incredible opportunity for us. This report, I think, is very important for the council to understand kind of where we are, what are pavement, what our street patterns look like, where we're going. And then and then moving on, we'll have we have some good questions. And so I would encourage the council to engage on this topic because it's it's very important. With that. Mr.. West Mayor, councilmembers members. You're absolutely right. This is a tremendously important topic that we're going to review tonight. In 2015, the council authorized us to begin a RFP to hire a company that would do a pavement management plan for us. That pavement management plan has done and I'm going to turn this over to our public works director, Craig Beck, and also our traffic engineer and deputy director of Public Works, Sean Crumby. And they are going to talk about the pavement management plan and our alley management plan as well. So, Craig. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. We are excited to. Bring forward. Tonight an updated pavement management plan, as the manager indicated. The council first adopted a pavement management plan back in 2015. It is best practice for city organizations, especially cities the size of Long Beach, to go through and update their pumps on a every 2 to 3 year basis. So we're back before you here this evening to provide you with an update and to go over what is the conditions of our street in the city. This is a. Prelude to kind of kicking off. The budget season, if. You will. We believe that the CHP program is an important element of the budget. As I know, council also supports that. And within the capital improvement program or CHP, streets will be a major category of expense. So again, tonight, we're going to go over the elements of of the condition of our streets. And the next time we come forward in part two, we will talk specifically about the amount of funding we have available and where we're making recommendations to prioritize that funding. So with that, I would ask our city engineer, deputy director Sean Crumby to go through the details of the presentation. Creating on our mayor and council. It's great to be here tonight. The presentation, as was mentioned, is going to focus on the state of the city streets and in particular what's been going on in the last few years. How do I fast forward? Can we get the presentation on the screens in front of us? Just to take services, please. Because it's not. Also, we're. Not able to advance the slides. Okay. So having some tech difficulties we need we built the slides to work and for us to be able to see it on the screens. Thank you. Okay. So what is pavement management? Pavement management is it's a process, a formal process where the city inventories, catalogs, inspects and prioritizes the repairs that will happen throughout the city in the most fiscally prudent manner. It's not just good practice. It's also people may not realize that most of the funding that comes into this program is through transportation funding, and a lot of that funding requires our pavement management. As was mentioned, best practice is every 2 to 3 years. And so this report seeks to come and do that. So pavement management rates every street in the city with a score called the Pavement Condition Index or PCI. The square starts at a high value of 100 for new streets and goes do\", \"Okay. Thank you. Next step is item 14. You know. I'm sorry, Adam. 15. Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to direct city manager to work with the fire chief to present a report on the status of one beaches Hart and 30 days. Go ahead. Thank you. I have done this in previous years. Doing this before the budget cycle is kind of what we do. This was one of the very first. Items that I was able to help usher through the budget process in my very first year on council, the Hart Team has been an organization that has helped augment some of our calls for those that are experiencing homelessness, as well as mental health challenges. I know in previous years we've had videos and great reports. I'm curious on the numbers and statistics about how the Hart team is working. I know that one of the Hart teams is able to respond to 911 calls. Would like to be able to understand that a little bit more how that's working out. And so I know it's a tight turnaround. I did check in with the fire chief ahead of this. And so I feel pretty confident about it and hope that my council colleagues will support this item. Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Rice. Mr. Mayor, I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this item forward and for including me on this item. And I just I am incredibly grateful for the program and everything that we have accomplished, especially when we're talking about things like social services and creative ways of addressing these common issues. And so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a report back. Vice Mayor Andres. Thank you very much. First of all, I think this is this item is a wonderful idea. I believe that we should board up these conversations and discuss online portals so everyone can access and connect this data, data and data from public outreach teams as well. You know, there's nothing more frustrating to a resident than calling to report a person experiencing homelessness and not receiving follow up, sometimes due to hyper or other factors. Information cannot be shared. But even if we could just sheer numbers like these, it would be a great, great idea. Thank you very much. Okay. Public comment, please. There's no public comment on this item. Thank you, Rocco. District one. My district to. I was district three. By. District four. At my. District five. I. District six. I. District seven. I.

Any comments? Those in favor of confirming the appointment. Please vote i. I opposed the motion carries an appointment is confirmed. Please read agenda item number 28 and ten. Item 28 cancel 1190 45. Relating to the sale and redevelopment of the former public safety building block, authorizing the execution of an amended receipt of purchase and Sale and Development Agreement with Bozo Development USA LLC for the construction of residential project with public parking, public open space and associated retail space authorizing the acceptance of an easement from Bowser on the property and authorizing Director of Finance Administrative Services to execute documents and take other actions. In connection with this project, the committee recommends that the bill passes, amended with the Divided report with councilmembers Burgess, Herbold, Johnson and O'Brien favoring councilmembers. So want a post from Burgess? Thank you. First of all, I want to start by giving a little history of of this project, which is directly across the street, across Fourth Avenue, where the old public safety headquarters building used to stand. None of us on the city council today or the mayor were involved when the city made a decision in 2007 to allow development of that site, including a civic square plaza. In 2007, when that decision was made. That followed a ten year process where the city engaged with a variety of developers and finally came up with the proposal that was won by Triad development. Due to the Great Recession and other issues, Triad has been unable to develop the project. The city has, since Triad failed, has been involved with four different attempts to find someone who could develop the project. And Bowser Development is the organization that has advanced the proposal that we will consider today. This legislation, if adopted, allows the director of FASB to execute an amended and restated purpose and sale development agreement with Bowser Development. The property formerly known as the Public Safety Building BLOCK. Bowser will construct a single tower residential project on the property, as well as a 25,000 square foot public plaza which the city has the right to approve the design of. Bowser will pay the city $16 million in sale proceeds, which will go to our Equitable Development Initiative. Bowser will pay the city a minimum of $5.7 million for affordable housing. The final amount of this affordable housing payment will be determined once the final design of the residential tower is complete. The project also calls for continuous operation of the Pioneer Square Transit Tunnel Station, which is located beneath this block. The total consideration for the city to receive here is approximately $50 million $16 million in sale proceeds. The minimum contribution of $5.7 million in affordable housing. The release of liability of the city, and the waiver of potential litigation costs. An immediate maintenance requirement. Once this ordinance is adopted by the Council, Bowser will take immediate control and will begin doing maintenance on the walls of the pit across the street. Some of that maintenance is needed almost immediately. The committee recommends that this legislation be adopted. Thank you very much. We want to highlight that there is no intention to shut down the product line. Comments, concerns or questions? Councilmember Johnson just. Wanted to offer a couple of quick things. One of the things that I think was important in my consideration of voting for this is that we also have a project labor agreement. That's one of the conditions of the proposed term and sale and that that project labor agreement has already been sent after. Washington, D.C. was a really great sign for us. The developer has a track record here in Seattle but is still relatively new to the city. So working proactively with our building construction trades to develop a project labor agreement that will bring more apprentices and more individuals to the construction trades, I think is going to be really critical here. That $5.7 million floor that Councilmember Burgess talked about would build at minimum 70 units of affordable housing here in the city and will be larger if it's found that the floor plates for the tower is larger than what was originally proposed by the previous developer. So good options here for us and really looking forward to the final action here this afternoon. Thanks very much for the comments. I'm going to ask the clerk, please call the roll on that. I'm sorry, Councilmember Swan. Thank you, President Herrell. I voted against this council bill in committee and I intend to do so again today. And I would like to take a moment to explain why this vote authorizes the sale of an extremely valuable city property to a big developer for $16 million, which I think would be an estimated at least an estimated $40 million less than its actual value. This sweetheart deal for Seattle's mega developers is nothing new, really. As was mentioned accurately, this property has been sitting idle for the past n\", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to. And worse yet, the public doesn't know what we're talking about or any background to this either. So that's at least an item I'd like to reserve to discuss whether, since we're all members of the City Council, that if we want to have something considered, we should at least have to go through the council referral process. But I know Vice Mayor matters. You want to speak on the Open House proposal? I actually have a similar concern. Is that. We don't have any detail on. On that and are we going to discuss detail and refer it on? That was my question. So so. Okay. Because because one of the concerns I have is are our agendas with the lists, \"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat was the key decision in the meeting?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Item number six, please. Communication from Council on Mango Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilman super novice Mary Andrews recommendation to discuss and enact related strategic planning initiatives with youth sports leagues in preparation for re-opening our parks to youth sports activities. Thank you. I appreciate everyone who signed on to this item. As many know, our youth sports programs are many nonprofit organizations and some are many businesses. They employ people who are coaches or referees, and they also have many, many volunteers and parents that participate in keeping the kids out and about and engaged in athletics, which keeps them healthy and strong. So we need to have a focus on ensuring that we are prepared to take on the challenge ahead of allowing multiple sports who are typically spread over a year to really prepare to come back and potentially play simultaneously. An example of this is some of our sports fields overlap each other and we wouldn't be able to in some facilities throughout the city, host both soccer and baseball at the same time. But there are adjustments that can be made throughout the city to make those types of things possible. So when and if sports can come back, we are prepared to give all youth the opportunity to get out there and practice their skills so as they move through and participate in their school sports, they have those knowledge, skills and abilities and talents to really help them through and keep them engaged in their schoolwork. So I really appreciate the youth sports directors that have reached out with you on better understanding your goals. And I think it's important to have a formal process where Parks and Rec really sits with the directors and casting directors that know and understand the complexities that can come about as we roll out the new requirements, which organizations are really prepared to do to meet that challenge and for them to be able to share ideas with people that aren't yet getting that kind of guidance from their national association? Councilman Supernormal. Thank you. And if that was the motion, I'd like to second the motion and just add to it that I fully support this and thank Councilmember Mongo for bringing it forward. We have the good fortune of having some baseball leagues in the fourth district, Durant Park Post, Long Beach League, Whaley Post, Long Beach Pro Baseball, and then where the North has a number of volleyball teams. Our council district has invested a lot into these facilities. We support them tremendously, and we'd really like to see them get going once again. Also to reiterate what Councilman Mungo stated, and that is these organizations can bring their own protocols to the table. So let's make sure we we listen to them as we move forward. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you so much. I appreciate I appreciate bringing this item forward. And I have kids who are in their youth programs in the city, both the city sponsored ones and also club ones. And I really do think we need to sit down and figure out how to work on protocols that make participation in these activities safe and feasible for our youth. I can say that as a parent of two children who have been out of school now for since March and entering into the summer, there is a lot of downtime for them. And I think team sports and sports activities that we're able to reintegrate into our daily lives will assist them tremendously in getting outdoors, exercising, staying healthy, making good choices, interacting with people outside of the technology world that they're most of them are operating in. And so anything that we can do as a city to help partner with these organizations to allow for safe reopening and participation, I would support and I appreciate Cassell and Mongo bringing this item forward. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Austin. Thank you. I just want to add my my my support to this item. Obviously, youth sports are extremely important and I really think it's part of the DNA of this city. So when we get back to functionality, we should have a plan to ensure that that our youth are safe, their parents are safe, and that they are having an enriched activity, whatever sport they are playing, either super active sports or not. And so I think there are also a lot of national organizations that are connected to many of these sports organizations that they can draw upon information as well. Our staff can draw upon information as well. But I do like the idea of working with local youth organizations, sports organizations throughout the city to to be engaged in the process, at least as as important stakeholders in the process. So congratulations. I really like this item and plan on supporting it. Council member Adam Quirk. Any public comment? Yes. We do have public comment on this item. Joel Davis. Um, you have 3 minutes. I may regret not to thank you for hearing this agenda item and allow it. My name is Joel. There's a current president o\", \"One, two. We're going to move on to our our our first our study session that we have scheduled tonight, which is actually a pretty important one. And so I just want to just give everyone just a minute to kind of a shake off their tiredness as we go into it here. But we're going to go we're going to go right into this first and then into the study session, and we'll then we'll continue the rest of the agenda. So our staff are going to give you I'll give you guys a minute to get set up. We can please load the presentation. The team. Carrie. Ready to go? Okay. Let me let me just make a couple opening remarks and we'll get right into it. Just I want to say that this is I know going to be, I believe, part one of a of a two part major presentation on ah, the state of our streets and the payment management plan that this council has been working very hard on ensuring that we implement. There has been a lot of excitement around infrastructure. I also want to add that the city is and has embarked on its largest infrastructure plan and street plan that we've had in probably 40 or 50 years. And so the amount of dollars that are going into our streets over the course of the next decade is significant. It's it's, of course, thanks in large part to the support of the voters with measure. It's also because of legislation that's gone that's come down the pipeline that's increasing our ability to to improve local streets. And so we are we're grateful that we're also grateful that Measure M, which was also passed by the voters, also adds to this to this pot. And so it's a incredible opportunity for us. This report, I think, is very important for the council to understand kind of where we are, what are pavement, what our street patterns look like, where we're going. And then and then moving on, we'll have we have some good questions. And so I would encourage the council to engage on this topic because it's it's very important. With that. Mr.. West Mayor, councilmembers members. You're absolutely right. This is a tremendously important topic that we're going to review tonight. In 2015, the council authorized us to begin a RFP to hire a company that would do a pavement management plan for us. That pavement management plan has done and I'm going to turn this over to our public works director, Craig Beck, and also our traffic engineer and deputy director of Public Works, Sean Crumby. And they are going to talk about the pavement management plan and our alley management plan as well. So, Craig. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. We are excited to. Bring forward. Tonight an updated pavement management plan, as the manager indicated. The council first adopted a pavement management plan back in 2015. It is best practice for city organizations, especially cities the size of Long Beach, to go through and update their pumps on a every 2 to 3 year basis. So we're back before you here this evening to provide you with an update and to go over what is the conditions of our street in the city. This is a. Prelude to kind of kicking off. The budget season, if. You will. We believe that the CHP program is an important element of the budget. As I know, council also supports that. And within the capital improvement program or CHP, streets will be a major category of expense. So again, tonight, we're going to go over the elements of of the condition of our streets. And the next time we come forward in part two, we will talk specifically about the amount of funding we have available and where we're making recommendations to prioritize that funding. So with that, I would ask our city engineer, deputy director Sean Crumby to go through the details of the presentation. Creating on our mayor and council. It's great to be here tonight. The presentation, as was mentioned, is going to focus on the state of the city streets and in particular what's been going on in the last few years. How do I fast forward? Can we get the presentation on the screens in front of us? Just to take services, please. Because it's not. Also, we're. Not able to advance the slides. Okay. So having some tech difficulties we need we built the slides to work and for us to be able to see it on the screens. Thank you. Okay. So what is pavement management? Pavement management is it's a process, a formal process where the city inventories, catalogs, inspects and prioritizes the repairs that will happen throughout the city in the most fiscally prudent manner. It's not just good practice. It's also people may not realize that most of the funding that comes into this program is through transportation funding, and a lot of that funding requires our pavement management. As was mentioned, best practice is every 2 to 3 years. And so this report seeks to come and do that. So pavement management rates every street in the city with a score called the Pavement Condition Index or PCI. The square starts at a high value of 100 for new streets and goes do\", \"Okay. Thank you. Next step is item 14. You know. I'm sorry, Adam. 15. Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to direct city manager to work with the fire chief to present a report on the status of one beaches Hart and 30 days. Go ahead. Thank you. I have done this in previous years. Doing this before the budget cycle is kind of what we do. This was one of the very first. Items that I was able to help usher through the budget process in my very first year on council, the Hart Team has been an organization that has helped augment some of our calls for those that are experiencing homelessness, as well as mental health challenges. I know in previous years we've had videos and great reports. I'm curious on the numbers and statistics about how the Hart team is working. I know that one of the Hart teams is able to respond to 911 calls. Would like to be able to understand that a little bit more how that's working out. And so I know it's a tight turnaround. I did check in with the fire chief ahead of this. And so I feel pretty confident about it and hope that my council colleagues will support this item. Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Rice. Mr. Mayor, I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this item forward and for including me on this item. And I just I am incredibly grateful for the program and everything that we have accomplished, especially when we're talking about things like social services and creative ways of addressing these common issues. And so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a report back. Vice Mayor Andres. Thank you very much. First of all, I think this is this item is a wonderful idea. I believe that we should board up these conversations and discuss online portals so everyone can access and connect this data, data and data from public outreach teams as well. You know, there's nothing more frustrating to a resident than calling to report a person experiencing homelessness and not receiving follow up, sometimes due to hyper or other factors. Information cannot be shared. But even if we could just sheer numbers like these, it would be a great, great idea. Thank you very much. Okay. Public comment, please.

Councilmember Ortega, will you please put Council Bill 20 2-0637 on the floor for final passage. From then on I move that council bill 20 20637 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearings for Council Bill 20 20637 is open. May we have the staff report? I think he council president. Can you introduce yourself? Yes. I'm Libby Adams with Community Planning and Development. And I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment at 4710 North Stuart Street. This application is located in Council District one in the Berkeley neighborhood, and the applicant is. Requesting to rezone. From you, as you see to you as you see one to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. As stated previously, the current zoning is urban single unit C, which allows the Urban House building form on a minimum size of 5500 square feet. The existing land use is a single unit home and this slide shows the existing building performance scale with the subject property on the upper right hand side. A postcard notifying neighboring property owners was sent out on March 24th, and then the planning board unanimously recommended approval of the rezoning on May 18th. And to date, staff has not received any comments from members of the public. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria that must be met in order for rezoning to be approved. The first is consistency with adopted plans, and there are two plans that are applicable to this rezoning. You can find more information on how this rezoning meets the strategies of a comprehensive plan in the staff report. I'll just focus on Blueprint Denver. So the. Future neighborhood context and Blueprint Denver's urban. And then the future place type is identified as low residential. And these are areas where ads are appropriate. And then the future street type for North Stuart Street is local and these are mostly characterized by residential uses, also consistent with the request. The Growth Area Strategy and blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. And then. Blueprint also has specific. Policy guidance. So the land use and built form housing policy four talks about diversifying housing choice by allowing aid use throughout all of our residential areas. Staff also finds the rezoning meets the next two criteria. It will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing our adopted plans and providing a new type of housing unit in a largely single unit area. And there's also a justifying circumstance in the adopted language and Blueprint Denver about its use in all of our residential areas. And then lastly. This proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context. The residential districts purpose and then the specific intent of the US. You see one zoned district. So finding all five criteria have been met. Staff recommends approval of this rezoning. Thank you, Libby. We do not have any speakers signed up to speak on this item this evening.

I move that council bill 20 1-1365 be placed upon final consideration and to pass. It has been moved. Can we have a second? It has been seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1365 is open. May we have the staff report? Good evening, council. I'm Jenny Guttenberg, senior city planner, community planning and Development. I'm also here with my colleague Becca Dyer Show, who is learning the ropes of our historic designation process and whom you'll be seeing more of in the future. She may assist me tonight with any design review questions that you might have for this historic district proposal. We are considering 19 properties on the east side of the 607 hundred blocks of North Steel Street in the Congress Park neighborhood. This is a new historic district proposal, not an amendment to the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons that you see listed on the screen. This application was submitted by three property owners who live within the boundaries of the proposed district. They spent the last two years developing the application and reaching out to other property owners to inform, educate and solicit their support for the proposal. The owners. Applicants of this district designation are Ken Fuller, Jane Pretzel and Tom Heath. The district is located within the Congress Park neighborhood and includes 19 primary structures 18 that are contributing. This is within Council District ten and blueprints under the areas within the urban neighborhood context and low residential area. Future place type. Current zoning is USAC. This is a dis contiguous historic district in two separate sections and was done in this way to avoid overlapping with the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district boundary. You can see by this map that a major justification for creating this new historic district is to include both the east and west sides of the 607 100 block of North Steele Street. The east side was left out of the 1993 East Seventh Avenue Historic District designation. This proposed district stands on its own with a period of significance from 1912 to 1990, while the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district has a period of significance prior to and including 1943. The proposed district meets all landmarks preservation ordinance designation criteria. It maintains its integrity. It is more than 30 years old. It meets three of the ten significance criteria. And it provides a historic context for consideration by the Landmark Preservation Commission. I want to mention the design review requirement for designated properties. Over the past several months, Landmark Preservation Staff engage property owners within the proposed district to clearly explain the design guidelines and design review process, including two community meetings, one in August 2021 and another in October 2021, as well as email communications with individuals. One of the major responsibilities of property owner who owns a historically designated property is to maintain its historic character. When a property is designated, it is designated as is and requires no improvements by the city. Maintaining a property's historic character is achieved through Landmark Preservation Design Review for any exterior alterations that require a zoning or \", \"Tonight, we have three public hearings for those participating in person.

Yes, I will. Thank you. I move that council bill 22 dash to 46, be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-2 46 is open. May we please have the staff report? Good afternoon, members of City Council. My name is Frank Benefield, Senior City Planning. Senior city planner with planning services. And today I'm going to present an overview of the MAP Amendment for 2039 South William Street. Subject property is in Council District six in the university neighborhood. The request is to resume to a district that will allow for any review of the rear of the property or other forms, and new standard standards will remain the same. The property is currently in the urban single unit season district, which is in dislocate in this location, would only allow for the Urban House building for a minimum size of 5500 square feet. And as you can see on the map, the property surrounded by other properties. Also shown us, you see there is a little bit of our age, 2.5, half a block to the east. And you can see some in is three half a block to a cell. The current land use it aside a single unit residential and it is mostly surrounded by other single unit uses. There is some two unit uses to the north and you can see the land use map that the University of Denver campus is only a block and a half a block, east and east Berry Elementary School is three blocks to the west. This light here shows that the subject property is on the bottom right and gives you an idea of the residential character of the neighborhood. Now speaking to the process. Information on notice of the application was sent on December 27th, 2021. Planning Board recommended approval anonymously on February 16, 2022, and to date, staff has received only one letter of opposition from the University Neighbors Neighborhood Association, expressing concerns with the potential increase of number of residents, vehicles and pets. This proposal could bring. The letter refers to this request for a variance and mentions the Board of Adjustments. An email was sent to the R.A. to try and clarify that this is a rezoning process and not a variance. Now moving onto Denver zoning code review criteria, it must be found that the request map amendment is consistent with the five criteria. The first criterion is consistency with the plans. There are two plans applicable to the rezoning Comprehensive Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context in Denver. And the future places map the signal US designates as a slow residential place. Displaced types have predominantly single and two unit uses, and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. William Street is designated as a local street, which are mostly characterized by residential use. Lupine includes also includes specific policy recommendations. Housing policy for focuses on diversifying housing choice through expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas. Stuff also finds that the request, the rezoning meets the next criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further \"]\n\nUser Query:\nSummarize the meeting in 10 words.\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

This includes things that I will say I have heard from the community or Tony and I have heard from the community. But again, most that most of this is mine or from other council members during the election, etc. This is a proposed potential list of things we could say yes or no to. So it isn't we are not necessarily proposing we run forward with all of this. But Tony and I really wanted to come back to this body and say, hey, before we spend any time working on this stuff, what do we want to work on it? So I thought it would be helpful because I think there's only one or maybe two things on here that are my own personal like things that I threw on here of going through and kind of talking about where where these things came from so that there's a little bit more understanding that it's not. John just going completely wild districts and ranked choice voting have come up districts came up at a community meeting that Tony and I attended in I believe it was December the Alameda Citizens Task Force meeting ranked choice voting is something that has come from a variety of Alameda progressives, the element, Green Party, etc. The different groups there have talked about that direct elect the mayor is something I've been talking about for about a year and a half or so, which is the idea that we changed at one point in time from what what some cities have, which is we elect city council and then the city council, like the school board, adopts or appoints a mayor. And oftentimes that mayor rotates once a once a year. So I think that there are some benefits to that, especially with the way we do boards and commissions, etc.. So if there was interest, we could look at that. Term limits, definitely. Something has come up both in the community and I've heard members of this body talk about that with everything that's been going on lately, whether it's Measure K or Measures B or yeah, the Sun Cow Initiative and whatever else, this idea of charter charter ballot initiatives and paid signature gatherers and looking at what we know. First question, is the charter the right place for any of this? But is there something we could do in the charter that might require not just spending a lot of money to tell people something they want to hear, even though they don't understand what they're being asked to sign necessarily. Campaign finance reform is definitely something that came up in it through the campaign for me, but has been coming up for at least ten years in conversations I've had. Removing housing restrictions, measure a and moving that language to the municipal code. That was both a staff recommendation and things. I've heard members of this body say that they were interested in discussing and looking at board and commission appointments. There was discussion at one point in time, actually at the city council about four years ago about possibly changing it. It didn't get three votes to move forward, but I figured I would throw that out there. And then the question is, are all the right boards and commissions in this? Tony is proposed finance commission and whatever else the Open Government Commission is, that's something that should be in the charter. Are these the right ones? I just wanted to, since we're having this conversation, say now would be a great time to consider this. And then lastly, and this is I'm going to say we have we heard slightly two different takes on what this could mean. And that's why it was written the way it was clarifying county council interference. And Tony, I think has some interest in this item, so I'll let you talk about that one. But we also the city received an independent report that suggested that we look at changing the charter language to clarify what interference is as well, looking at the removal of the auditor and treasurer. So we made changes in 2008. We've made some changes through the years of what the auditor and the Treasurer is. You know, I've definitely heard many multiple people suggest that and I have also been one of those people suggest that they don't need to be elected officials. They do very, very little work actually. They spend a lot of time. But the actual their actual jobs are just a few hours a year for the most part. It's not clear why. It's clear why they used to exist, because they used to actually have a whole workload. But we now have a professional staff that does most of the work and they basically just sign off on most of it. So the question is, why are we electing these two positions and what are they bringing? Council pay has definitely been something that's not just me, definitely something that that former council people have talked about for many years. If we want to have a broad breadth of people who run for and tried to be on the city council, we can't assume that everybody can afford to give up 20 hours a week for $100 every two weeks. No, sorry. A month. Sorry. I just a\", \"Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to our our study session then, and which we have scheduled today, which is a big staff presentation. I want to I'm going to open it up and let me know, Mr. Modica, when you guys are set up and ready. We're ready. Okay, great. We have actually let me go in first. Do you want to read the city section into the record, please? Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive and file a presentation on efforts related to the Clean Language Initiative. Thank you. And I am thankful I've been talking to staff about bringing this study session forward. And it's something that I know is not just important to me, but it's important to everybody on this dais. And we've been talking about this for as long as we've all been, I think, together as part of this body, the cleanliness of the city and ensuring that neighborhoods, regardless of where they're located across across the city, are clean and well maintained is incredibly important. I also want to make sure that I think we're all aware that during the pandemic, the the impact of the pandemic had on cleanliness was was serious. And we have gone through a health recovery. We're going through an economic recovery and making sure that we also recover so that neighborhoods have the streets sweeping on time, that trash is being picked appropriately, that dumped items are being are being picked up when they need to be. The corridors are being cleaned up is also really important when you think about a year and a half now where you had much of your staff or many staff members, whether they were sick or they weren't able to go do certain certain functions of their job. It did impact cleanliness when you had more homes producing more waste. That also impacts cleanliness. And when you have different patterns of travel, that also impacts cleanliness. When folks from your from from certain departments are unable to do certain work because they're out working at getting folks healthy or vaccinated or tested, that also impacts the work that we can do as a city around cleanliness. So we have had a difficult year and a half, but I'm really proud of the staff, is doing a great job of bringing this back and I look forward to hearing the presentation. We want to make sure that Long Beach is is a clean community for everyone that is here. And I know there's going to be a lot of questions. I have some as well that I'll I'll ask of you guys as soon as the presentation is over. I want to thank you guys for the work that you that you did with this and the memo that you sent to council earlier today. And I view this as a very important initiative for the team and for the staff as we move forward across this next year. So, Mr. Modica. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. That was a very good overview. We are going to have a presentation that kind of has three parts today. We're going to talk about a lot of the investment that this Mayor and council have made over the past four or five years. It's been impressive considering where we started. We didn't really have this kind of clean language program. We created it and just about every year we added to it. Every year, though, we kept getting more and more requests. So the better we did, the more requests we got for our service. And you'll see that today. Do you asked us to do probably 20 to 5 different initiatives as part of that over the years. We're going to report on those today. Almost all of those are complete or we're going to be getting to a lot of those or a couple of more of those as we do the Recovery Act. We're also going to go through some of the data of what it's looked like over the last year. That was one of the strangest years we've had from a from a refuge perspective. And the mayor mentioned a, well, just patterns changed and demand changed and the team really had to adapt to keep up with it. And then we're going to talk about what's next. We have for at least two years, we have some dedicated resources to really invest and do things we've never been able to do before. So I will turn it over to Eric Lopez, to Nico Mokonyane and to Chris Coons, who I'm sorry, Chris Hubert, who will go through the presentation. Thank you, Tom. I want to reiterate that maintaining a clean city is one of our department's highest priorities. We have heard loud and clear that this is a priority for the mayor and the city council, and it's a priority for us as well. So we've throughout the years, we have built a strong, clean team that continues to improve and evolve. And the present presentation today, I think, is going to demonstrate some of that evolution and some of the improvements that that we continue to make. So with that, wanted to turn it over to Decode McClennan, our deputy director. Go. Good evening, everybody. Thank you for having us here tonight to give this presentation. We're eager to. Share with you some of the challenges we face and some of the some of the successes we have had and anticipate. So\", \"Motion carries. Item 2711. Communication from city attorney recommendation to adopt a resolution acknowledging racism as a public health crisis and establishing a framework for reconciliation citywide. Gave a motion by Councilmember Richardson and a second by Councilmember Pearce. We got a public comment, please. There's one public comment for this item. Dave Shukla, your time begins now. Oh. Hello. Sorry. The bloody bishop. This is a very important item. It. Yeah. I mean, I can't stress that enough as someone who the only enemy he has is a hundred years of carbon trapped in the. It's kind of easy to attract content. But for everyone's lived experience right now, there are all the decisions that were made tonight, made from a place of lack of knowledge about how they'll affect certain groups more than others. And a lot of the unintended consequences that we hear about from public policy discussions, we need to kind of fill that in in the 21st century . We need to kind of look at the data that we have so many different events, but but specifically on how certain groups of people. How you have their freedoms as a result of keeping other people unfree. That's not what this country should be about. Thank you very much. Black Lives Matter. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item. Councilman Richardson, you want to speak to the motion there? A few thoughts on that. Some are just some changes here. So first, I want to just acknowledge Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Pierce, who all signed on to the initial recommendation that started this on this framework reconciliation path. We've had two meetings, the last meeting, and it's one in 55 people in the listening session. I think it was in terms of listening sessions go, it was incredibly powerful and the things that we heard, what folks opened up and shared. I don't think has ever there's ever been a forum on the record for that to ever have happened, and that's incredibly important. I think the events that are taking place in our country with respect to racial injustice, it's an important moment for me. You know, for me personally and for a lot of the members of this council. Typically, when we pass a resolution, these are ceremonial moments and some of them means different, significant things. I think the fact that, one, our city council is unanimously declaring racial inequity as a public health crisis is important, and that makes me proud as a city. Secondly, it's important that we started off this process of this framework by acknowledging and so the original the original resolution that was proposed did things like acknowledge police violence in America and within our city. And it allowed us to acknowledge that so that we could, you know, start in the same place in terms of moving forward into listening, into convening and into catalyzing action. I know that traditionally in our process and this is I'm speaking for the public to understand this process, a lot of times we bring a resolution, we'll bring a draft, city attorney will make edits that draft, and it comes back to the council to make edits to the draft . So I know that there were pieces in here that were that were that were removed. That's the process. And we tonight, the council has the ability to put that back in again. These resolutions, you know, they they really sort of help reflect the statement that the council is trying to make. So and so I know that I've had the conversation with the city attorney and the city prosecutor about reinstating some of that language. I know that Councilwoman Pearce wants to speak to some of that, too. So we want to make sure that that language is is restored. I think it's also important for this moment in history that the resolution also proclaimed that Black Lives Matter. I think that's important. That is reflected consistent with, you know, this moment in history. And when our city looks back at this moment in history, we want to make sure that we acknowledge this movement for black lives and the role that is playing here. So that's it. That's my emotion. And I want to hear some of the feedback from the second. Councilman Pearce. Thank you and thank you so much for speaking to that. And yes, historically, whenever we bring items to the Council for a vote, a resolution, we ask the city attorney to draft it. And this resolution was drafted quickly and put as an example. And so I want to speak to the statistics that are that I'd like to put back into this, and I want to highlight that all the statistics that I'm going to suggest putting back in are numbers that our city has provided us, either through PD or through our Office of Equity in the Health Department. And so I will have this all written up and sent back to you, Mr. Parkins, with the exact language that was given to me by the Office of Equity. And so the original item was getting out. I'll go through it quickly because I know that you have it, but 13% of Long Beach is p\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat were the main points of discussion?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

So really, the city's discretion here is simply the design of the building. The planning board had a study session in October of 2018 to just to review the overall design of the building, the size, its compliance with the zoning code to make sure it met all of our zoning requirements. And then two months later, they had another public hearing and approved the project in December of 2018. That decision was then appealed by the neighbors of the project. The City Council held a hearing on February 5th, considered the appeal, considered the Planning Board's decision, and upheld the Planning Board's decision. That decision that the Planning Board made to approve the project had two remaining items that the Planning Board had asked the applicant to do, which one was to come back with final architectural design elements for the building. So the scale, size, height was all approved, but they wanted to get more details and an articulation on the building . So they asked the applicant to come back with that. They also wanted more detail and some fine tuning to the landscape plan. The City Council, at your hearing after upholding the planning board, said, Yeah, we absolutely agree. Planning Board, you should keep working on those two items. And we would also like you to take one last look at the setback of the building from the water and consider pushing it back ten or 15 feet. You didn't tell them to do it. You asked them to just consider whether that was a good idea or not. Two days later, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, a board of Directors Board of Commissioners, held a public hearing to discuss this very same project and determined that it was completely consistent with their guidelines, standards and rules, and that it met their set back requirements and provided an appropriate set back to the water from Bccdc perspective. We then followed that up with two neighborhood meetings. Then on May 28th, the planning board held another public hearing, and at that meeting they considered the staff recommendation, which at that point was to not move the building back any further. We did not feel that we should push the building closer, push it back away from the water, because we felt the distance from the water was appropriate. And equally important, we felt that to push it back towards the neighbors would simply make the building appear even taller. So and there was at the neighborhood meetings on February 16th and May 11th that we had had prior to May 28th, there was no no support and no requests from the neighbors to pull the building back towards them. So we made that recommendation at May 28th. The planning board did not get any public speakers asking that the building get pushed back towards the neighborhood and they approved. The building setback. That decision was then appealed. And that's the one of the decisions you're considering tonight. But they did not approve the final designs and the final landscape at that at that meeting. We then had two more community meetings. And then on July 22nd, the planning board reaffirmed and re-approved the project setback and the final architectural details and lighting. So this is a project that the planning board has worked very hard on. And as I said earlier, we feel they they made the right decision. The appellant makes three arguments. One is there weren't enough community meetings. The planning board is required to have notice public hearings. They held those public hearings there. They completely fulfilled the requirements of the zoning code in terms of public meetings. All of the extra neighborhood meetings I just talked about were extra meetings. So there is no requirement for any more meetings. The other two issues related to the appeal are about the setback of the building. What this slide shows you is a couple of things. The the orange area shown is the footprint of the building in December. And if you look very closely, you'll see there's a there's another footprint sort of superimposed on the orange. You can see that is the final footprint. It was approved by the planning board. So you can see if you look very closely, the building got ever so slightly longer. It got a little narrower in places on the width, but the basic set back never changed. The reason the the configuration changed slightly is we were working with the applicant and the planning board was working on the applicant and the neighbors were working with the opinion to get more articulation into the design. So the design sort of you got some more ins and outs, more reveals the overall design of the building improved over this period. The actual square footage remained basically the same. The actual location of the building remained the same. We didn't move it back, as I said earlier. The another thing that has not changed is this relationship of the set back to to the waterfront. So we didn't move the building back. The thing that I'll just point out here is the requirement \", \"Good evening, Mayor. I am Ninette Mercado and from the Community Development Department. As was stated, as has been a topic before the council in three closed sessions and tonight is its second time in the public. At the April 2nd City Council meeting, the Council received a public presentation of the proposed lease with Nautilus Data Technologies for the public. Nautilus Data Technologies uses innovative water cooling technology to operate data centers that reduce the costs of computing power usage, eliminate water consumption, decrease air pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This would be their first site for this technology. And so it's it's a cutting edge technology at that meeting. At the April 2nd meeting, Nautilus provided an overview of its project, but consultants related to its proposed technology. Environmental engineers who would lead the permitting process and the consultant we use to locate and construct the harbor seal haul out advised them and spoke about the project's input . Our impact on the SEALs. In addition, there was a representative from the trade unions and a high tech tenant from Alameda Point who spoke in support of the project. The council asked to postpone the decision on the lease until the city had an opportunity to discuss the Site B development project and any impact Nobelist might have on the development. During the tour, the broker pointed out that we crafted and and novelis accepted a smaller parcel to allow for a greater development opportunity for site B. So tonight we're returning to ask for lease approval for for this lease for a term of 15 years with two five year options, which was negotiated as a result of council direction. The tenant has agreed to pay a development impact fee, also requested by the Council for a total of $1,562,971. At filled out, the project will contribute one and a half to two and a half million dollars in revenue for Alameda Municipal Power, which will help AMP keep rates low for residents. I hope that tonight you will consider this recommendation and support the lease approval. Thank you. The applicant is here if you're. Any questions that you might have for them. Thank you. Okay. Council. Question. Council Member Vice Mayor Nothing like this. I'm not sure this might be my first vote. This requires four votes. Yes. So I guess my question is, before we have any conversation, it seems like there have been a number of council members who have voiced strong concerns about this. If there are two or more of those, I think in the idea of expediency. I would love to know if there are people who are concerned not going to have talking. We can we can take a straw poll. Does anyone have any questions they want answered? However. Odie. I'll wait to the straw poll. I mean, I do. But it's not. You want a straw poll to asking any question? It would just be to reinforce my opinion. So maybe I'm not going to ask them. Why? Well, I should. Be honest about it. So. So. Well, for one, I'm not ready to vote because I want to hear council's discussion. But if you I mean, do people. You mean do people truly know how to vote now, how they're going to vote now? Councilmember De So you look quizzical, I'll say. Yeah, well, I'm kind of quizzical because I know that for the most part I've been quite supportive of this project and I don't see any reason to change my mind. Since we first discussed this, at least I first discussed this in the closed door, largely because I like the impact, their contribution into the into the feet. So it's not the 100% fee, but it's. But at 1 million plus, it is something. So the developer. Devoting. 40% of their to. That. I know that I could just speak for myself that, you know, I will continue to be supportive of this project. Okay. Councilmember de SAC Gleaning Support. Vice Mayor. I you know, I would want to have a conversation about some monitoring and and outcomes of the monitoring issues that I think would be problematic for the applicant. But I think if we could get there, it's a project that I could potentially support. Okay. Leaning support. Um, yeah. Councilmember Vela asked me to. Just logistically, it's easier. She goes last in the comments, but are you ready to comment? Well, I was skeptical before, and I'm still skeptical, even more so based on the tour that we did a couple weeks ago. Okay. Leaning skeptical. Councilmember Vela, who's going to come to us over the say? Are you there, Councilmember Vela? Yeah. Here you are. Hi. So you followed that. We're taking just a little informal straw poll here. I still have some outstanding questions. I think I think they're you know, the thing right now, I think, um, you know, potentially could be helpful to our conversation. Well, I think I think probably. And then questions regarding the the police. Um. And, uh, including the length of it and. The actual what was something about the lease? The term actual term lease? Got it. Okay. So is it you could be persuaded.

I move that council bill 20 1-1365 be placed upon final consideration and to pass. It has been moved. Can we have a second? It has been seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1365 is open. May we have the staff report? Good evening, council. I'm Jenny Guttenberg, senior city planner, community planning and Development. I'm also here with my colleague Becca Dyer Show, who is learning the ropes of our historic designation process and whom you'll be seeing more of in the future. She may assist me tonight with any design review questions that you might have for this historic district proposal. We are considering 19 properties on the east side of the 607 hundred blocks of North Steel Street in the Congress Park neighborhood. This is a new historic district proposal, not an amendment to the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons that you see listed on the screen. This application was submitted by three property owners who live within the boundaries of the proposed district. They spent the last two years developing the application and reaching out to other property owners to inform, educate and solicit their support for the proposal. The owners. Applicants of this district designation are Ken Fuller, Jane Pretzel and Tom Heath. The district is located within the Congress Park neighborhood and includes 19 primary structures 18 that are contributing. This is within Council District ten and blueprints under the areas within the urban neighborhood context and low residential area. Future place type. Current zoning is USAC. This is a dis contiguous historic district in two separate sections and was done in this way to avoid overlapping with the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district boundary. You can see by this map that a major justification for creating this new historic district is to include both the east and west sides of the 607 100 block of North Steele Street. The east side was left out of the 1993 East Seventh Avenue Historic District designation. This proposed district stands on its own with a period of significance from 1912 to 1990, while the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district has a period of significance prior to and including 1943. The proposed district meets all landmarks preservation ordinance designation criteria. It maintains its integrity. It is more than 30 years old. It meets three of the ten significance criteria. And it provides a historic context for consideration by the Landmark Preservation Commission. I want to mention the design review requirement for designated properties. Over the past several months, Landmark Preservation Staff engage property owners within the proposed district to clearly explain the design guidelines and design review process, including two community meetings, one in August 2021 and another in October 2021, as well as email communications with individuals. One of the major responsibilities of property owner who owns a historically designated property is to maintain its historic character. When a property is designated, it is designated as is and requires no improvements by the city. Maintaining a property's historic character is achieved through Landmark Preservation Design Review for any exterior alterations that require a zoning or \", \"Okay. Thank you.

We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Item ten. Yeah. Item number ten. Communications from Council Member Rex Richardson, Chair of the Federal Legislation Committee, but recommendation for approval of the 2015 federal legislative agenda as recommended by the Federal Legislation Committee. Okay. I think I'm to turn this over to do I turn this over to Ms.. Tang or Councilman Richardson. First, their staff report. Let's do this. Let's do it. Do the staff report. Yes. We'll give this over to Diana Tang. Okay. Mayor, members of the city council. Back in January, January we January 27th, the Federal Legislative Committee had a hearing and we took up the 2015 proposed federal legislative agenda. There was a robust discussion among the committee, and the committee recommended several changes which. Have been reflected in the stock report that you see today. And so with that, I'm available to answer questions. Okay. Councilman Richardson. Thanks. I thought there was going to be a little bit more of a staff report. I'll tell I'll tell folks what's what's in this legislative agenda. There are a number of things and some of that. Some of them have been high profile. One of them was the AH expressing support for federal legislative changes to ensure that Petco products were covered as they train, as they come in from out of state. So we went ahead and added that to the federal legislative agenda. The committee added a number of other things, like support for the minimum wage increase as proposed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors two 1010 an hour paid maternity leave. Federal legislation for that comprehensive immigration reform. Some business friendly policies. Some language on a holistic approach to gun control. So there were quite a few things here. So there are. So it seems like on a number of these, there seems to be some uncertainty on on readiness on behalf of the council to move forward. So I would add one change that we not make changes to for different items and keep the original language so that we can rework these in committee. It just seems like they're not ready to go yet. So one of them is that we want to change, remove the changes from fire protection, medical marijuana, affordable housing and airport passenger facility charges, and just keep the original language in the original Fed led agenda and so that we can rework those because it seems like there's a lot more discussion and to be made in the committee. So that's my motion. Okay. There's a second by Councilman Councilmember. Would you just one more time repeat those sections again? So you said. So it's the Fire Protection Directive. So we're going to keep original language and send that in that back to committee to rework medical marijuana. We're going to do the same on that council directive on affordable housing. We're going to do the same. And on airport passenger facility charges, we're going to keep we're not going to make any changes there and rework those in committee. Okay. And so just so I'm clear, so those items we sent will be removed from the federal committee and then sent back to committee, and then your proposal would move forward. The agenda minus those items? Yeah. Minus those changes. Okay. Okay. I have a motion and a second. I'm going to do public comment and then I have some speakers. Any public comment on the item? Please. Diana LA genes again. Hi. I actually have a little bit of a question. I'm not quite understanding where the medical marijuana you're asking that to be removed from the from the federal pledge or some changes that are that. I would hate to see that particular item totally removed because that's really at the forefront right now. And we do need to continue with that. Is I misunderstanding something? I think I believe the the motion is to have these items be taken up at committee so they can be retrieved and stopped. So my understanding is that the Fed ledge agenda exists. We update it once a year. Right. So we proposed the commission. The committee proposed a certain number of changes to certain elements. I want to hold off on those changes and rework those changes in committee. So. The changes are what we're holding back on. Oh, okay. I was not quite sure. Okay. So fine. As long as it's not totally on is. I know it's coming back. It's a very, very important issue. I mean, it's at the forefront right now. So. So then the next thing that I would say is, is there a way that we can prioritize certain items, like, for instance, because it is so much in the forefront right now that really does need to be addressed very strongly. And I know it was put on the Fed, uh, federal legislation, um, before, but I'm just wondering how strongly that is going forward. And perhaps if there is a way to prioritize these items, that that should be one of the priorities. So that's what I'm I'm saying that perhaps there should be some items that you prioritize in your dealings with the with the feds that certain items should come forward with more priority. Okay. So that's\", \"negotiator is this former dam employee organizations are IBEW, EU, a ACA and NCAA and under negotiation of salaries and terms of employment. Thank you. Now turn to closed.

Three C presentation by the United States Green Building Council to the city of Alameda for the Alameda Main Library Project. Pretty cool. Evening. Mayor Spencer and members of the City Council. I'm George Saki, library director for the Alameda Free Library. Excuse me. I'm very pleased to be here tonight to have my project team. With me as the city receives our. Lead gold for. Existing. Building. I want to really thank my project team. Building Wise was our consulting firm. Barry Giles is the founder and CEO. And he is here with us this evening. Levi Jimenez was our senior project manager. He couldn't make it tonight. Yvette Becerra is also a project manager with Building Wise. Westlands from. Stop Waste. Dawg really pushed us through this project and was a huge, huge help. Maria de Meglio, I think, was the heart and soul from Public Works. She's a. Project specialist. And really. Kept our project moving and attended to all the details that didn't fall through the cracks. Britney and Kerri from AC. I helped Maria a lot. Digging through our garbage. Thankless job, but we really do thank them. And tonight, we're honored to have Kevin Hydes, who's a member of the Northern. California chapter of the USGBC. To actually do the presentation. So I don't want to spend too much time at the podium. I'd like to bring Barry up here to say a few words about our project. Thank you. Madam Mayor, Vice mayor and members of the council, thank you so much indeed for the opportunity to be here this evening. I'm Barry Giles. I'm the CEO of Building Wise, and we are the consulting company that worked with your team to get them through the process, to get them to the end and get this great plaque put on the building event. And I and I'm sure she would say as well, it's we've been in this business for some years. We are a very experienced consulting company. But one of the main things we know is that we cannot complete these buildings without the help of people in there. And Jane and Maria, without fail, have been pushing and arguing and helping and asking all the difficult questions of the members of the team and to get us through to this program. So now you are in a moment going to be presented with this plaque and the building will be called, we believe, the first library in the nation to get a version for all of this LEED existing building program. What are you going to do next? Because the one of the big things about lead and the lead program, especially the lead ebb program, which I was very fortunate enough to write back in year 2002, is that we wanted people to continue to work on the building. And one of the ways to do that is to ask you, it's not mandatory. Can we come back in five years and do it all again? Because what is important is the data that comes back from that. How are you maintaining the building over the over the next few years? How are you improving it? No, we don't want you spending millions of dollars on the building. We want you to work with the team that you have and Wes Sullins and stop waste and everybody else who was part of this to maintain the building so that we can keep it going. The other big advantage of doing this building is that we generated a lot of new programs. We had policies. We have programs that went through the council, went through a lot of the public works. They can be replicated very, very easily in other buildings that you have. I assure you, plagiarism is alive and well with the USGBC. We'd love the opportunity to do it again. Now, without further ado, I introduced introduce Mr. Kevin Hydes, who's here representing the U.S. Green Building Council. Yeah. There's two of us with an accent. I'm Kevin, and then I'm mayor and council members. Don't say I don't need to say much after Barry. But I will say that the thing about certification, which I think is so important, it's actually something very tangible. And your public of obviously elected the members here to represent their values and vision and deliver on this this lifestyle that you referred to earlier. I love those words. I love this notion from the earlier awards as well that, you know, you're actually acknowledging and rewarding your own people that go the extra mile. You know, I think you should acknowledge and reward yourself for going the extra mile, you know, as leaders in your own community. And as Barry mentioned, these these certificates are really important certifications. It is the first in the country for a library with version four. You should be very proud of that. But as Bob knows, it's a journey. It's a journey. And this is this is you know, we celebrate today and then we move, move on. I'll remind everybody that two months from now in Paris, you know, the countries of the world, the major, our own governor and major and mayors from cities around the world are going to arrive in Paris to talk about climate change and what actions are they going to take to help the planet at large. And I think what, A\", \"Item 14. Item 14 Recommendation two to approve submittal of the list of grant applications to potential funding agencies and to accept and expend all grant funding in connection here with city wide. There's been a motion by Councilman Andrews, a second by Councilmember Durango. Mr. City Manager. Our public works director are a million. Honorable Vice Mayor and honorable council members. I have a PowerPoint. If you're interested in a 20 minute presentation, I'm more than willing to do so. Otherwise, I have handouts. Or I can do a very short synopsis for you. I think the handout and a short synopsis will be fabulous unless you have an interpretive dance you'd like to offer with that. But. In short. Brief synopsis. Honorable Council Members Metro provides an opportunity for local jurisdictions to apply for projects that improves transportation. Pedestrian activities, bicycle activities and so forth. So this is called cold call for projects. It happens approximately every two years or three years. And it is slated for this call for projects, is slated for moneys to be awarded in 2020 or 2021. So we're looking for a five year or six year period. We have identified eight projects. Two of these projects have been previously applied for, but we were not successful. Reason being is Metro uses very complicated system to grade the agencies. So we have taken those two projects that we have previously applied and we have improved upon them. So to increase our chances of winning. So there are eight projects. One category is regional surface transportation improvement. That includes the seventh Street connectivity. Basically, we're looking for enhancing the entire seventh Street corridor between the Shoemaker Bridge towards East, and that includes bicycle, pedestrian traffic, signal modernization, synchronization and so forth. In the same category is Artesia Complete Boulevard, and that's the same vision that Councilmember Rex Richardson had through the COG. So this is going to kind of kickstart this process. And if we're this is all contingent upon if we're selected and we are where the winners of these grants, we have three bicycle improvement projects, which is one is Walnut and 52nd Street. The other one is Atherton Bridge and Campus Connection. And finally, it's the L.A. River Gap Closure. Those are the three bicycle improvement projects that we're submitting. For our pedestrian improvements. We had a downtown pedestrian improvement project, which is in Council District one and two. We also have a signal synchronization and bus bus speed improvements. This is on seventh Street, Fourth and Broadway that. It's the entire corridor. And finally, we have one last category, which was transportation demand management, which is part can, right? So and in the few following pages you will see, we have shown the estimated project cost, estimated grant request and the match. A metro requires that we have a minimum 20% match. We have shown the funding sources and none of them are the general fund. We're using transportation funds to match these and also the 20% is minimum. We haven't made a strategic decision yet. If we want to increase that to two basically by points, by increasing our match will have a higher chance of winning. But this is something that we have to do at the staff level, but it's something that's under consideration. That's my report on this. You have a specific question. I can elaborate more. Councilmember Richardson. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to say thanks to all the staff that put together this proposal. And I know this is not the first time Artesia Boulevard has been on this proposal. I've seen I think this is maybe the fourth time I've seen RTG be applied for either Caltrans or MTA. But I think with the team that you've put together to really, really drive this, we've got a good shot this time. So I'm really excited and thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez? Yes, I think you are. These are great projects. I'm very excited to see a few of them in the First District. And my question is geared towards the great seventh Street, the Connectivity Project. Now, how will that be married, I guess, with our park? I mean, is that I know that's in the works. Correct. So the guy Minor Park project, if you can envision or visualize, it's between Alamitos and Atlantic. So we are trying to mimic the same kind of traffic enhancement that is west of Atlantic, all the way to Shoemaker Bridge. This is again has to marry up with the future Shoemaker Bridge and looking at more of a complete street, maybe decoupling the traffic all the way to the Shoemaker Bridge. So those are all possibilities that will be studying. Great. Thank you. There's been a motion by Councilman Andrews and seconded by Councilmember Urunga. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address Council on item 14? Please come forward and state your name. Very good you cook as they dress. I have complete confidence that our director of pu\", \"Recommendation to approve Otis Drive, Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Project Design Concept Recommendations. All right. So we have. Who do we have here? Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Scott Wickstrom, the city engineer. Tonight, along with David Parisi from Parisi Consultants, we will be presenting the Otis Drive Traffic Calming and Safety Improvements Project. As council member, I'll know the slide projectors not in service. And so our one, we have the best slide presentation that the public will never see. That said, I'm going to go through and really try to hit the highlights of the entirety of the presentation staff report as well. Written should be very thoroughly and will certainly be available for questions at the end. And I will just add that the staff report is available online and the presentation is excellent. So if you're really interested, you can take a look at it online. Thank you. So I'm going to I'm going to jump ahead and I'll kind of let you know the title of the sheet. I'm on the third slide, which is the project goal, and it's singular. I was very specific about that. It's to improve safety for all users. It's really reducing driving speeds. That's one major component about it. It's also improving safety for pedestrians at crossings. It's providing for bicycle safety that doesn't really exist in terms of a dedicated bike facility on the street right now, improving bus stops, operations and then, where possible, doing green infrastructure. Next slide this will be a phased approach project. Two years ago, with the capital budget, the city council authorized or appropriated $500,000 to study this, to reach out to the public through public workshops and then bring back forward ideas. And what we are proposing to do is a two phased approach. The initial phase will be short term, relatively inexpensive, predominantly paint type based improvements that with a request that has been before you already with the 1921 capital budget, an additional $500,000, we believe we could implement final design this fall and actually construct in spring of 2020 should the Council approve our initial approach tonight? There's also some long term improvements that are proposed with this project that depend on the full menu of potential improvements may cost several million dollars and we would be soliciting grant funding for such a project. We are not asking council for final approval of those long term improvements at this time. We're really focusing on looking for approval of the short term recommendations project schedule. We've had a survey that went out last fall. We've held two community workshops. We've been to the Transportation Commission twice, most recently on May 22nd, in which case the Transportation Commission voted 4 to 1 to support the project. And I would say that all five commissioners were in general support of the project. There was one the one dissenting vote was more of a concern about the treatment of the bike facility adjacent to Rattler Park, which we'll be talking about a little more in the future here in this presentation. So as I mentioned before, if approved by council tonight, we're looking to finalize design this fall and go into construction in 2022. Jump ahead a couple of slides to where we talk about vehicular speeds. It is a concern. Everyone who's driven out at unnoticed drive can pretty freely attest to that. I'm sure the residents can speak to it pretty, pretty freely. And they have regularly told us during during our workshops, a couple of notes, you know, the average speed depending on where you are in the quarter, somewhere between 28 and 30 miles an hour. The 85th percentile, which is really what the police can enforce at, is 33 miles an hour. And during a single day, when we recorded speeds in a single afternoon in February, the max speed recorded was 75 miles an hour down the stretch. And the police department has assured me that that is not unusual to see excessively high speeds because of the straightness, the with the lack of stops or other traffic calming devices on the street. Next slide is really types of collisions, and they're kind of clustered at a lot of the intersections. I want to call just one thing to do for which is there's a variety of types of different types of collisions that are tracked. But for the vehicle, bicycle vehicle pedestrian it at this point comprises 19% of. The collisions. And as you would run to the very next slide, you look at the injuries and fatalities over that same four year or five year period. Those 19% of incidents comprise 54% of injuries. And there was one fatality not too long ago at one of the intersections on the street. Moving to next slide, which is traffic volumes, I spend a little bit of time here because it's kind of important to what we're really ultimately proposing to do here.

Thank you. Thanks again. And we're going to go ahead, go back to the regular agenda item 29. Report from Technology and Innovation Financial Management Recommendation to authorize the city manager to submit to the City Council purchase transactions for critical technology infrastructure needs citywide. Mr.. Mr.. Mayor. Council members, this, as the city Clerk pointed out, deals with critical infrastructure in the technology arena. We've already had a study session regarding this subject with the city council. It's been on the council's agenda a few weeks ago, but it was like 1130. Postponed till today. So here you go. Basically, we were looking at the history of financing in Long Beach and dealing with technology. In 2001, we were facing a $103 million deficit. It took 3 to 4 years to deal with that, but we stabilized the budget and dealt with that. In 2008, we faced the greatest recession since the Great Depression. That took a long time to recover from, but we did that as well. During the past decade or so. We focused a lot on streets, sidewalks, buildings and roads, but not so much on technology. During the past couple of years, we've conducted a major review of technology and infrastructure, technology, infrastructure throughout the city. This review is turning out that we have big needs to be the 21st century technology city that the community council commissioners all want us to be. We've discovered that we've had some critical technology needs that are imperative for us to deal with things like a new fiber network. Things like replacing outdated technology, replacing outdated equipment, security cameras, and dealing with the issues we're facing with those a brand new CRM system dealing with cybersecurity and electronic document management systems. So I also want to make it clear that we want to do this in a fiscally responsible way. For example, in our fiber buildout or replacing our outdated technology or even in transitioning into electronic documents, we want to know that. We want to make it clear that if the private sector can work with us for cost efficiencies, such as public private partnerships, will be open for innovation and working with our partners throughout the community to do that. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Brian Stokes, our director of technology and innovation. He's going to walk through the operations that I've just noticed here, and then I'm going to turn over to our finance director. John GROSS is going to talk about the funding. And the funding here is significant. It's a potentially $60 million of purchases throughout the next several years. This is something that won't be dealt with here in 2018, but certainly will be dealing with in 2019. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian. Thank you. Good evening. Honorable Mayor and City Council. At a special City Council study session on October 24th, staff presented a report outlining four critical technology infrastructure needs the city is facing and at this time to ensure we can reliability reliably and efficiently service our residents. Tonight, we'll discuss the details of these critical needs, as well as the estimated cost and potential financing and funding. Currently, staff is seeking approval to bring forward for Future City Council consideration. Three of the four key categories of unfunded critical technology infrastructure needs. First is installing a fiber optic network so city buildings can save on current and future communication costs and to form the basis of a potential future digital inclusion, replacing outdated technology that's becoming unreliable and will not support new systems or the new civic center and furnishing needed systems to make key critical city needs and prevent malicious system attacks. Data loss and service outages. The total of these three items come to $67 million. The remaining 21 million is in a fourth needed category, replacing our public safety communication technology, which is not being recommended for action at this time, as additional information pretending pertaining to extended support is anticipated to become available in the next few months . If the recommended action is approved, staff will finalize the specific purchases secure vendors through existing and new contracts for bids, secure funding and financing, and in conformance with the mechanism outlined in this letter. A Return to the City Council for authorization of individual purchase transactions. To create a plan for action for expanding the city's fiber network. We completed a citywide fiber study that addresses the needs for faster data speeds between city facilities in order to accommodate the new technology systems that we are currently in the process of implementing. It's like a giant. You cannot you can't be talking inside. I'm sorry. You need to go outside, sir. Thank you. Please continue. Thank you. As I was saying, this is addressing a need for faster data speeds between city facilit\", \"A report of the Economic Development, Technology and City Write Committee Agenda Item one. Resolution 32056. A resolution related to the city write department adopting in 2023 through 2028 strategic plan update for the satellite department and endorsing the associated six year rate path. The committee recommends the council bill be passed. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Nelson, the floor is yours. COSAT Nelson. One moment. Please. Okay. Item number one. So if you can hear me first, I'd like to give some background. Resolution 32056 would adopt the City Lights 2023 to 2028 strategic plan and endorsed the associated rate path. But by background, I went to explain that the disruption of the pandemic in 2020 interrupted the expected update of City Lights Strategic Plan in rate path. In recognition of the economics due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The executive did not transmit and council did not take up rate setting legislation during 2020. In 2021, Council approved rates for 2021 and 2022, and they were effective in April of 2021. So in differing from regular practice, City Light proposed in council adopted a five year, not a six year strategic plan for 2022 to 2026. So now in 2022, City Light has proposed a 2023 to 2028 strategic plan starting there, the the normal two year cycle of planning and rate path determination and rate change adoption and because only one year has passed since the adoption of the previous plan. City Light characterizes the 2023 to 2028 plan as an update rather than a wholly new plan. So what we have before us has been approved by the review panel and unanimously passed out of committee last Wednesday. HSA and Wilson. Are there any comments or questions regarding this or Councilmember Nelson? Casper Peterson. Thank you. Council president. The resolution approved last year Resolution 32007. Scheduled electricity rates to increase by 3.8% in 2023 and by another 3.8% in 2024. But City Lights resolution before us today is asking the council to increase their rates by a higher amount, 4.5% in 2023 and another 4.5% in 2024. I appreciate all the hard work she does. I appreciate the thoughtful rationale for the utilities proposal, consistent with my comments on substantive changes and rate increases that I have communicated to my constituents. Though I'll be voting no on today's resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, is there any other comments customers want? Thank you. Guns have proven worse as I've done previous years. I will be voting yes on this legislation approving Seattle City Life Strategic Plan. It accurately analyzes what resources city will need to continue its important work. However, as I've said in previous years, also, I would not agree that working people who are now facing punishing inflation should be asked to pay any rate increases. Instead, Seattle should be increasing the rates on big business. For that reason, while I'm voting yes on the strategic plan, I intend to vote no on rate increase legislation as long as it continues to put the burden of those rate increases on working people. Thank you. If your customers want this or any other comments or concerns. All right. I have some closing comments. I was just going to do that comes from Nelson. So why don't you go ahead and have a closing comments before we go to a vote? Well, I do want to acknowledge Councilmember Peterson's historic knowledge. I really appreciate that you have that perspective coming into this year's vote. It's true. We're talking about a 0.7% increase from what was anticipated to be the 2023 rate increase to what is actually proposed in this plan. And I just wanted to explain a little bit about what's behind that. So City Late developed the average rate for 2023 by including inflationary costs from 2021 in 2022 that were not included in city lights, operations and maintenance budget for those years. And in addition to that, the the inflationary adjustment from 2022 to 2023 is a significant driver. So, you know, right now, the the inflation is anticipated is the current projection is I believe it's C 7.8. And when that last plan was adopted, the projection was 5.1. So that is a significant driver. And also it's noted in the report and I want to make clear that the people watching this know that City Light makes plain that the annual increases of the proposed rate path fall short of anticipated inflation in cost going forward. So they are absorbing some of the the higher than usual inflationary costs. And in the past two years, just for an example, some of those cost increases when it comes to city lights cause steel, aluminum and copper increased 70 to 80%, conduit 33%. So that those are the sorts of things that they're grappling with. And two councilmembers once point many people lost their jobs and it is but city light didn't turn off people's did not close accounts in they are currently operating under $44.7 million in arrearages. So I acknowledge that I acknowledg\", \"Opposed the bill passes and the chair will sign it. Please read the next letter to the record. Pagina 913 Resolution 318 66 Establishing a watch list of large, complex, discrete capital projects that will require enhanced quarterly monitor reports for the 2018 calendar year. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted. Great. Excellent. Thank you. With much. Thanks to Council member Lisa Herbold at its other end, did you want to bring forward an amendment at this point? I do, actually. So we have a proposed amendment to the resolution as as discussed in committee that creates an expectation for where the. Quarterly reports. On the projects that are included on the watch list will be heard. Part of this enhanced reporting and oversight of large capital projects not only includes having some shared expectations with the executive, but it also requires, I think, a change in focus on the council that we actually agree to find a time and a place at our committee meetings to hear what the what the reports coming out of these specific projects say. And and with the idea that if we hear those reports in committee and we identify problems with projects on the the watch list, we will be able to better hold ourselves accountable for addressing those problems with scope or budget as they are identified. So it's important, I think, to actually embrace the role that the council has by affirmatively stating that we will hear these reports in a council committee. And so that's what this amendment does. Should I read it? Okay. So Amendment one two, Resolution 31866. Basically, like I said, memorializes the city's intent at the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee, review the enhanced quarterly reports, and it states the city Council anticipates that the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee or Successor Committee will review the intent enhanced quarterly reports. Any other comments? Oh, okay. So it's been. So are we moving? It was moving. She's moving it. I'm seconding it. It's been moved and seconded and the amendment will be adopted. Any comments? No more comments. Those in favor of the amendment vote. I think those opposed the motion carries and the amendment is adopted. Great. And I'll just speak to the underlying bill then as amended. So this resolution establishes a watch list of complex capital projects, something that Councilmember Herbold brought up during budget. And page three of the resolution establishes the initial watch list of the complex projects. Quarterly The mayor will provide us an enhanced list, and the oversight will primarily be focused on scope, schedule and budget of the individual projects. And as noted by this amendment, it will come to the Finance Committee. We will get this started in the next quarter and will invite all who are have any specific projects from their committee. As I mentioned this morning, if it's transportation, we will invite Councilmember O'Brien, give you plenty of notice to know when it's coming up and then if you've got any issues around it, we'll get more information before the vote. So with that, I would like to propose that we adopt this resolution as amendment. So all right, then we're done with that. So those in favor but lightweight to adopt resolution 31866 as amended. I think there's a second already. Yeah, yes. Yes. Okay. And there's any other comments. Oh, Councilor Johnson. Thanks. Just sorry about that. That's okay. I understand. I just want to thank Councilmember Herbold for continuing this conversation. I think the a lot of this germinated when we all many of us started on the council in early 2016. And we're faced with the prospect of several major capital projects that were at 100% of their budget, but maybe only 80 or 90% through their scope. And folks were coming to us and asking for forgiveness rather than permission. And and what were we going to do? We were we had left with no choice but to approve additional resources, because the thing that was going to get built or the thing that we were buying was the thing that we needed. And I think that the intention here is to create opportunities for the council to have better communication with these individual departments and individual project managers as the projects move forward so that we have a chance to choose maybe some changes in scope or changes in timeline of deliverable delivery without having to necessarily be the recipients of bad news at the end of a projects budget when the project wasn't still yet complete. So I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out over the next several years. Councilmember O'Brien I wish you luck because 11 of these 18 projects are transportation related. So it seems like you're going to be spending a lot of time and councilmember back sales committee, though you are not necessarily a member of it. And, you know, I just think that this is at a base level a lot of what we should be doing as as government, working closely with those project managers to make sure \"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat considerations were made for the project timeline?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Madam Clerk, would you now please read docket 0600? Certainly I could 0600 council zero off of the following wardens to create a task force to address literacy rates in the city of Boston. Thank you. The chair now recognizes the chair of the Committee on Governance Operations, Councilor Lydia Edwards. The floor is yours. Thank very much. I, I unfortunately could not chair this hearing. So I want to thank my vice chair, councilor at large, Michael Flaherty, for doing that. I do know that this is the conversation is to continue, however, and that the matter would stay in committee and work. We would have a working session to talk about the composition responsibilities of the task force. So now I'm going to turn it over to the vice chair and then, of course, the lead sponsor. Thank you, Madam Chair. The chair recognizes the vice chair of the Committee on Governance Operations, Counselor Michael and Vice Chair Michael Flaherty. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a very important issue in our city. This will establish this ordinance will establish a literacy literacy task force to examine literacy rates. They will study the rates of literacy across Boston among adults and children, and also help develop a plan that will also put programs and policies in place to address literacy in the city. There's also a task force membership where non city Boston employees would be able to get a $100 stipend not to exceed a certain amount. And we had a great conversation with the administration and with the panelists that the lead sponsor had assembled. And questions remain. Of course, we put to put a series of questions in front of the administration. So we look forward to further discussion with the administration alongside our colleague and lead sponsor, Julie. Me here. Through. Through the chair to the lead sponsor. Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. Chair now recognizes the lead sponsor and the At-Large Council from Dorchester Council. Julie May here. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to Council Clarity for chairing a great hearing. It was incredibly inspiring to be able to sit in a meeting with so many experts in their fields uniting around a common cause. Thank you to the advocates who made their voices heard Edith Bazile, Elizabeth Santiago, Lee Harlan, as well as members of the administration who came to offer their support, including during wind use of valley, Jennifer Viola Wang, Christine Duvalier. And we learned a lot about people. We learned a lot about we learned a lot about people who this ordinance was designed to help and how we can make our efforts even stronger. The first thing we learned is that this is a pathway to literacy is different for everyone. And while some people it may take a matter of months, for others it may be years before they are able to get on that path. This is why it's so important to ensure that one of the responsibilities of this task force is to find ways to make access to services easier for people who cannot read or write in any language. Because while people are learning to read and write, they also still need help with the services that our city provides. The second thing we learned is that people who are relying on these literacy services are coming from all back to all types of backgrounds in need services that are catered to their lived experiences. Some people are coming as doctors and lawyers from their homeland who can read and write in their native language but have very limited English proficiency. Other people have never learned to read or write, even in their native language, because of war, lack of funds, family obligations, physical abilities and more. We need services that cater to each of these groups that allow them to thrive. It seems like forming this task force will be the best way to ensure that we're coordinating and consolidating our services in the best way possible. And I also just want to take a quick moment to acknowledge that, you know, we talk a lot about the school to prison pipeline here in the city of Boston. And I think this is a key opportunity to really look into how a lot of our young people are struggling to read and write and showing up with social and emotional issues in class. And oftentimes they end up in d y. Yes. So if we can tackle the issue of literacy and get a handle of it, we might be able to address the school to prison pipeline. Then we also have our returning citizens who are coming back from incarceration and struggle with reading and writing and are unable to fill out a job application. So I think about those folks. It's a really serious about addressing the issues of violence and poverty. And this will be an opportunity for us to really look at some of the root causes of what some of our returning citizens are experiencing. And then we're thinking about those who are coming to this country and juggling to make their \", \"grade you. Thank you very much. Okay. Let's bring up our next panel, which will be 2016 0473 and in a minute. Yeah. Okay. This is developing a plan for addressing major technology emergencies that might occur in three different departments that we wanted to start with. The Office of Emergency Management, Natural Resources and Parks and the Department of Elections. Mr. Hamburger, would you begin? Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the record, Patrick Hamacher, I'm I'm apparently being joined by Mr. Gillis. I'm also delivering a report for Mr. Giambattista, who's there in the office today. The proposed motion before the committee would call on the executive to work with three departments between the departments and committee to come up with a plan to address emergencies and the way that they would handle it. Related Emergencies within the department. The project, which essentially would start out like a pilot project, would require the departments to work with KCET on how they would be alerted on upcoming events, a schedule for major events that could be adversely impacted by I.T. emergencies. The how the how KCET would be alerted if there were issues to come up and the a resource or on call plan for dealing with those issues. That plan would be required to come back to the Council in April of next year for review and could lead to more widespread roll out throughout the county. And that concludes my staff report. Madam Chair. Thank you. That's pretty straightforward. Thank you very much, Mr. Key. How would you like to make any comments? Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the record, Bill Kehoe, King County Chief Information Officer I think this is a a very good ordinance. It will improve the coordination between city and our separately elected agencies in our executive branch agencies when we have an event and an event can be a flood warning and could be an election cycle . There's many events that could occur that require our assistance and coordination. So this will formalize what we are trying to do today, which is to coordinate much better with our agencies around these events, make sure that we have the right recovery plans. If something were to go wrong, make sure we have the right resources on call, make sure that we have alerts so that we don't make any changes to our technology during one of these events. So there's moratoriums that we have to adhere to. And so we're looking forward to working with our with our agencies, in our executive branch departments and increasing the coordination and collaboration to make sure that nothing goes wrong during these critical events. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Robertson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think a couple of weeks ago we had the emergency management program leadership. Judy Miller. Who was it? Judy Miller. Yeah. That was before us. And she said that we're trying to get cell phone numbers into our system, but we have to rely upon people calling that registering. And what that did, to my mind, is say that a lot of working class and poor people get different cell phones every four or five months, and they rarely would think about even if they saw ADVERTISMENT on TV to register with anybody. So my question to you is, how do we get information about an emergency that has are out the down quickly? Are we just we're out of luck. Thank you. Mr.. Mr.. Gossett, I think for this, this audience is really for internal coordination. For external coordination and our residents. You know, that's difficult for, you know, the folks that you mentioned. I think there's email, there's texting potentially is other technologies that we could look at in addition to the cell phone. But unless someone has access to that, it is difficult. Yes. And there's no way that every time someone gets a new cell phone number, it just automatically goes into our system. That was that technology doesn't exist yet. It probably does exist, but it certainly isn't something that we have available. You have to work with the various phone carriers and sometimes their cell phones that are, you know, just for day use or, you know, they're free, essentially. So those are more difficult as well. But that's a that's a real that's a really good problem to look to solve in the future. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. And thank you for remembering that we were briefed on some of the emergency needs and the coordination. And so I'd like to thank Carolyn Whalen, Judy Miller. Christy, true. And of course, you, Bill Kehoe, for the coordination on this and being willing to put this together so that when there is an emergency that the phones don't go to get overwhelmed or the computers slowed or crashed. And if they do happen, where do we do next to make sure that that doesn't happen for very long? Council member of the Grove. Thank you, Madam Chair. Bill, do you anticipate you can do this with your existing staffing and resources yet? That's a great question. I was actually thinking about that as I wa\", \"Let's give them all a round of applause for serving and thank them. Thank you. We're going to go now to our item on the Queen Mary. And it's a it's listed as both a presentation and agenda item. So we're going to move that agenda item and just do the whole thing here in one item. So if I can have the clerk, please begin by reading item 25 and then I'll kick us off. I'm sorry. Now that I'm 25, it's item number 17 and they'll kick us off. Report from Development Services recommendation to receive and file the guiding principles recommended by the Queen Mary Land Development Task Force District to. Thank you. We're going to before we turn this over to two staff, I just want to make a couple opening comments. I want to just begin by thanking first the council and then the task force that the council formed, this Queen Mary Tibet Land Development Task Force probably about a year ago or so. And Vice Mayor Lowenthal at the time had brought this forward along with myself, just to ensure that we would have a extensive community input process throughout. As far as developing these principles and guidelines for the development of the Queen Mary land around the Queen Mary. As a reminder, this is probably some of the most important undeveloped land, not just in the city, but really in the region. This is significant property. It is adjacent to our iconic Queen Mary. And there's a lot of potential to really connect this parcel to the rest of the city and build something really special for not just Long Beach, but really for for the region and for the state. So it's been an exciting process. And I want to start by thanking all the members of the task force. This was a a phenomenal group of people that served on this task force. There's four of them that are here, but I want to thank each of them first. The chair was Michael Bowen, who is going to be saying a few remarks today, who, as we all know, is a senior principal and design director at Studio 111. Geoff Hoffman, who wanted to be here so bad but is actually traveling for work. Who's who's vice chair of Hoffman and Associates was the Vice-Chair Ryan Elton Toon, who we know is a developer and the executive VP of Energy and Pacific Stewart Ashman, who was the CEO of Mohler, Becky Blair from Blair Real Estate. Julia Wang, who I know is here, who is the founder of Imprint Venture Lab and the CEO of Inner Trend. Kathleen Irvine from the from the community in the Willmar City area. Ken McDonald, who is the CEO of Long Beach Transit. I see Cheryl Perry, who's here, who is with Long Beach Heritage and president of the Long Beach Navy Memorial Heritage Group and one of our premier historic preservationists in the city. Kelly Ruggiero, who is the executive director of the Long Beach Symphony. And Kelly is also here. Steve Sheldon, who is the director of entertainment events at the Queen Mary. I saw Steve here. If he's not here now, he was maybe spoken in and out, but I did see him. Come in. Come in down here. And John Bendis, who's the principal and founder of German DS, Inc., I know if you want is here or not, but it's it was a a phenomenal group. They've worked very hard. They've been putting together a lot of their work. And you're going to see the culmination of their work tonight. And so with that, I'm gonna turn this over to city staff. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, we certainly agree that the task force has done a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of visioning and bringing community input into what is really Premiere site in Long Beach. So Linda Tatum will go through from development services, will go through a bit of a staff report to give you an overview and highlights of what their work product was in your packet, you have kind of the full report which gets into a even greater detail and we'll give a summary of the great work that the care that the task force did. Linda Thank you, Mayor, and members of the Council. I'd like to start by just acknowledging the staff that worked on this incredible project, and that would be to my left here, Fernandinho, who's the planning staff? She was the project manager. I'd also like to recognize one of the our department's interns, Olivia Jonge, as well as our department director, Amy Bodak. And I would also like to acknowledge the assistance that we had, the very capable assistance we had from a project designer, an architect, a local architect who assisted the task force in their deliberations. So with that, I'd just like to introduce the overview of this project by acknowledging that the selection of a new leaseholder for the Queen Mary site was a very opportune time for the city to step back from the site and take the opportunity to really significantly reimagine what could occur on the site. It's an underutilized site. And this time and the appointment of the task force really played a critical role for the city to re vision that site. So with the mayor's creation of the task force there, their charge was multifold. I\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWho is responsible for completing the tasks?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. And I really appreciate the community's efforts and staffs to continue this massive project and policy. All right. Next nine e. Consider reviewing and updating the rules of order for city council agendas and meetings. Keep in mind that council members are required to finish deliberations by 5 minutes. It was placed on the agenda of council member. We will set a timeline of 2 months. Okay. As as with head to toe in a role. I want to finish this one quickly. Actually, this came to my mind after having gone through the two meetings that are referenced in the referral, the referral list request that we consider appointing a subcommittee of our members or tasking the Open Government Committee to review the rules of order. Of the city council. And the reason I think this is important is because we had a couple of meetings, the workshop on the 17th and then the meeting of March 7th, where there was confusion over. How people should be allowed to speak and what were what are basically what are the rules of addressing the council and even among the council themselves? And I received from the city clerk on request the resolutions that pertain to rules of order. And there are some very interesting items in these referrals. I mean, in these resolutions, including. For example, the power of the council to either allow speakers to address the council or anyone else other than the council to address the council during deliberations. That's a council decision according to one of these resolutions. There's also a three minute limit on council members in the deliberations. So it's there are some interesting things, and I think there's also interesting rules around. The limitations of a speaker to address the council and items four and eight. According to the way I read this, it could be read that they could speak on anything they want, including an item that's further agenda. I think it's good to review these and to see if they need to be updated, but just for public awareness . Additionally, there seems to be a gap in and this comes up periodically when there's a very contentious issue is how the agenda is put together and who has responsibility for it. It's really not defined anywhere, clearly, either in the charter or in the rules of order. So I think those are important enough to do whether they're to this, I don't think this is a high priority. I definitely think we should have it looked at and I think a disinterest as I read reread my referral, which was written in March. I think it would be a good task for our Open Government Committee to do as a as a as a, I could say, disinterested party, but a party that's interested in making sure that government is is clear and understandable to to us as well as the public. Let's go next to Russia. I think you raised some good points. Council member matter. I, I would want the both the city attorney's office and the city clerk's office involved in. Any review because I want to make sure that we are I mean, at some point, it might be appropriate to have the Open Government Committee take a look at this. But I want to make sure that we are up to date on all the applicable laws and rules. And I think that the city attorney's office in the city clerk's office are a great place to start, unless they are the last stop before it comes back to us. But in any event, I do think I would want to hear. From. Both of those departments. Me too. And Brody. I mean, again, I thank you for for doing this. I think this is something that's sorely needed for the reasons you mentioned Councilmember Meter, S.C. But also, I think, you know, the public seems to be more cognizant of the length of our meeting times and maybe the quality of our interactions, which with each other. So, I mean, I think if if we could find a way to improve that, I think that would that would be helpful. I mean, I think we all, myself included, we need to look in the mirror on a lot of those things. So and I wonder if maybe having a subcommittee of the council might be more fruitful than having the Sunshine Committee look at it. But I do agree with my other colleagues comments at the city clerk and city attorney should be involved and they don't seem to have a lot of things on this list. So I'd be I would be happy to, you know, participate with any one of the four of you on the subcommittee. I would be happy to participate with you. Councilmember Brody. My preference is to go to vice mayor. Sorry. You know, one thing I do want to be cognizant of. Why do you think it's important that we get updates if there's any other laws or potential conflicts? I would want to be cognizant to make sure that we're not trying to censor or, you know, kind of sway the Open Government Committee in terms of making a decision. So while I would like to hear from our city attorney and our city clerk on that process or if there's any potential conflicts or issues in conflicts, I just I think we just need to be very cognizant of that because we are talking about, you know, the public's ability to\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to. And worse yet, the public doesn't know what we're talking about or any background to this either. So that's at least an item I'd like to reserve to discuss whether, since we're all members of the City Council, that if we want to have something considered, we should at least have to go through the council referral process. But I know Vice Mayor matters. You want to speak on the Open House proposal? I actually have a similar concern. Is that. We don't have any detail on. On that and are we going to discuss detail and refer it on? That was my question. So so. Okay. Because because one of the concerns I have is are our agendas with the lists, \", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. We have decided to set a timeline of 6 months. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat were the decisions made in the meeting?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Resolution 32056. A resolution related to the city write department adopting in 2023 through 2028 strategic plan update for the satellite department and endorsing the associated six year rate path. The committee recommends the council bill be passed. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Nelson, the floor is yours. COSAT Nelson. One moment. Please. Okay. Item number one. So if you can hear me first, I'd like to give some background. Resolution 32056 would adopt the City Lights 2023 to 2028 strategic plan and endorsed the associated rate path. But by background, I went to explain that the disruption of the pandemic in 2020 interrupted the expected update of City Lights Strategic Plan in rate path. In recognition of the economics due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The executive did not transmit and council did not take up rate setting legislation during 2020. In 2021, Council approved rates for 2021 and 2022, and they were effective in April of 2021. So in differing from regular practice, City Light proposed in council adopted a five year, not a six year strategic plan for 2022 to 2026. So now in 2022, City Light has proposed a 2023 to 2028 strategic plan starting there, the the normal two year cycle of planning and rate path determination and rate change adoption and because only one year has passed since the adoption of the previous plan. City Light characterizes the 2023 to 2028 plan as an update rather than a wholly new plan. So what we have before us has been approved by the review panel and unanimously passed out of committee last Wednesday. HSA and Wilson. Are there any comments or questions regarding this or Councilmember Nelson? Casper Peterson. Thank you. Council president. The resolution approved last year Resolution 32007. Scheduled electricity rates to increase by 3.8% in 2023 and by another 3.8% in 2024. But City Lights resolution before us today is asking the council to increase their rates by a higher amount, 4.5% in 2023 and another 4.5% in 2024. I appreciate all the hard work she does. I appreciate the thoughtful rationale for the utilities proposal, consistent with my comments on substantive changes and rate increases that I have communicated to my constituents. Though I'll be voting no on today's resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, is there any other comments customers want? Thank you. Guns have proven worse as I've done previous years. I will be voting yes on this legislation approving Seattle City Life Strategic Plan. It accurately analyzes what resources city will need to continue its important work. However, as I've said in previous years, also, I would not agree that working people who are now facing punishing inflation should be asked to pay any rate increases. Instead, Seattle should be increasing the rates on big business. For that reason, while I'm voting yes on the strategic plan, I intend to vote no on rate increase legislation as long as it continues to put the burden of those rate increases on working people. Thank you. If your customers want this or any other comments or concerns. All right. I have some closing comments. I was just going to do that comes from Nelson. So why don't you go ahead and have a closing comments before we go to a vote? Well, I do want to acknowledge Councilmember Peterson's historic knowledge. I really appreciate that you have that perspective coming into this year's vote. It's true. We're talking about a 0.7% increase from what was anticipated to be the 2023 rate increase to what is actually proposed in this plan. And I just wanted to explain a little bit about what's behind that. So City Late developed the average rate for 2023 by including inflationary costs from 2021 in 2022 that were not included in city lights, operations and maintenance budget for those years. And in addition to that, the the inflationary adjustment from 2022 to 2023 is a significant driver. So, you know, right now, the the inflation is anticipated is the current projection is I believe it's C 7.8. And when that last plan was adopted, the projection was 5.1. So that is a significant driver. And also it's noted in the report and I want to make clear that the people watching this know that City Light makes plain that the annual increases of the proposed rate path fall short of anticipated inflation in cost going forward. So they are absorbing some of the the higher than usual inflationary costs. And in the past two years, just for an example, some of those cost increases when it comes to city lights cause steel, aluminum and copper increased 70 to 80%, conduit 33%. So that those are the sorts of things that they're grappling with. And two councilmembers once point many people lost their jobs and it is but city light didn't turn off people's did not close accounts in they are currently operating under $44.7 million in arrearages. So I acknowledge that I acknowledg\", \"Agenda item three Resolution 318 26. Wellington Cell Center City Bike Network Assumption and Implementation Schedule for this year department transportation delivery of capital projects that are elements of the Center City Bike Network and requesting quarterly status updates to the Chair of the Sustainability and Transportation Committee through 2018. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as member. O'Brien. Thank you. I'll just speak briefly to this. And then we have a substitute, which a lot of folks on the dais here weighed in to help craft and let folks speak to that. The general impetus for this is to lay out a 18 month plan for how the city will take some significant steps to completing the downtown Protected Bike Network. This has been a specific set of investments that has been central to the bike master plan, and other community advocates have been pushing for this and there've been a number of setbacks. So just going to be honest, the city has postponed and delayed various aspects of this a number of times to the frustration of many in the community, including myself. But out of that frustration, we had a chance to work with the department and advocates on identifying projects that can be completed in the next 18 months. I will say that this is an ambitious set of plans, but that every one of these there are no major. Or. One, should I say there's no obstacle that we don't see a way to overcome in the next 18 months. So we have a plan that's short term and we're going to be monitoring this very closely with report backs in the committee. And I look forward to moving forward and getting these things built in the week and a half since we had our committee meeting and at our committee meeting. A number of colleagues who showed up at committee meeting had a number of really great suggestions. We have incorporated all those suggestions into a substitute version, so I would go ahead and move to amend Resolution 31826 by substituting version three for version 1D, which includes a new attachment B. And then I would let my colleagues each speak to the various components that they had a hand in crafting when we get to that point . There has been moves in second for the new version three. Who would like to speak on components of the new version? Now. Just wait if someone feels the need to go first. Councilmember Johnson's. Please go. First. So just briefly, the section that Councilmember O'Brien worked with me on was Section ten. And Section ten relates to not providing quarterly reports back to the Council on evaluation of the performance of the transportation system, particularly downtown. We are living in a city that is rapidly growing, and there's a couple of ways that we can try to manage that growth. From our transportation network perspective, one would be very expensive and that's to build a whole lot more roads. And to do that, we would require to tear down buildings and do all kinds of ridiculous things. The other is for us to really do a better job of managing our existing environment, and that I think we're doing through these quarterly reports. Growth means we need to use our space more effectively and more efficiently than we're using it today. It means that we need to think about throughput and how many people are going through the city into and out of the city every day and maximize the existing right away that we have to the best of our ability, in particular downtown. We know that we've got, you know, a very high percentage of households that are living without a car. We know that one of the best ways we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions is to encourage folks to get around without a car. And that really, particularly for downtown bike riders or those that are coming to downtown on their bike, that this is one of the places where we need to have a highest emphasis on safety. It's a place where there's a lot of conflicting modes and a lot of people that are looking at a lot of different things, whether that's their phones in their cars, whether it's the screens in their cars, whether it's the best friends around them. There are a lot of distractions downtown. So the more we can do to create protections, the safer we're going to be for those folks that are riding into town every day. So enthusiastic about this resolution, I think to Councilmember O'Brien's point, we've set ourselves a pretty high bar here, and I'm hopeful that we can really make it very good. Thanks for the explanation, Katherine Johnson. Councilmember Mesquita. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Councilmember O'Brien and to his staff for your ongoing work on this legislation and for your work with us in my office to really identify if there was a way for us to use the language in the text of the resolution to call out the priority populations that we really want to address intentionally. We want to make sure that this is a bike network that's available and accessible for all ages and abilities, as\", \"Sorry. Lieutenant. I appreciate the quick. The adoption resolution requiring a project stabilization agreement for certain construction projects. All right. Is that you? Assistant City Manager Burton? It is. Good evening, Mayor. As the Ashcraft vice mayor. Bela, members of the city council. I'm Jerry Bowden, your assistant city manager. And I'm here tonight with a recommendation that essentially it's to consider adopting a resolution for a policy that would require the negotiation of a project stabilization agreement for certain types of construction projects in the city of Alameda. Just very quickly, as you all know, we do have we have all been working with project stabilization agreements. These are essentially what usually amount to agreements entered into by project owners or developers with members of the building trade unions. We do have a PowerPoint. I'm not sure how helpful it is. I could just very quickly. Okay, I'm seeing the city head shake now. We're going to work right through. Yeah, I'm actually I'm going to just jump in, Mr. Burton, because I know you're aware of some of the conversations that have been going on today. But I my comment is that when I read this item, I was concerned that we are seeking a policy that would require adoption of this resolution. If we pass this resolution, as is, it requires adoption by applicants. Owners and developers are only focuses on the concerns of the building and construction industry in the in the language in the terms that would be in this project labor agreement. And so what I and also I was concerned when I learned that staff in putting this proposal together didn't actually consult beyond the the building trades construction group. And you know, it's that's a that's a great place to start, but not to finish. My concern is that. I. Think, you know, that I am all about housing. We need to build housing. We need to finish projects. They need to be efficient, economical. It says as much in the staff report, but an effective play has to be more than just an agreement not to strike. It has to address the concerns of all the parties to the agreement. So I did some research and I discovered that in fact there are good examples of just some additional language that I would want added to the proposal that staff has come up with and which I could support. And, and this actually comes from and it was attached as council correspondence in your packet this afternoon. It is a successor project labor agreement to the Mission Bay South Development in San Francisco was known as a very successful construction project. The developer was could tell us it was entered into by the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, the AFL-CIO and affiliated unions. And the major items that I would want to see is the the inclusion of a requirement to to negotiate with women owned business enterprises, minority owned business enterprises, small local business enterprises. And then also that we added section, which is found on pages four and five of the correspondence that was attached. And it is titled Management Rights. And, and it's, you know, it's there the language is there for you to read. But it is just important to recognize the perspective of the owners, the perspective of the developers in getting these projects together. It's a it is a three legged stool that is going to fall if all the the the legs are not stable and strong and so on. Today, I had several conversations with Andrea Cleaver of the Alameda County Building Trades Council. And yes. We are public speakers. We haven't entered comment yet. Okay. I just want to just want to say that this is a direction that I would like to see us head in. So any other questions about Mr. Bowden Springs Park before we launch into public comment and then our deliberation? Councilmember Spencer. I think I saw your hand up first and then de and then not quite. Okay. So I have seen this same resolution attached to a referral by a member of ODY and members hour earlier, and then it was withdrawn. It didn't show up. Right. It sometimes removed from the agenda. And now this is coming forward by the city manager and I'm really not sure what happened there. And so can anyone address what happened to the referral and why do I have a staff member bringing this? And that just seems weird to me. I don't know how and I've actually heard that there have been discussions going on for 18 months and yet as far as I know, council has never approved a referral for staff to be working on this. Mr. Burden or Mr. Levitt, do you want to give the history on this? Sure, I can. I can give part of the history on this. So the city council has had, as part of agreements, as far as development agreements, going back before I was even city manager, where there's been some projects that plays were on development agreements. There's been different points in time where it's been concerning to different parties or to developers.

Any comments? Those in favor of confirming the appointment. Please vote i. I opposed the motion carries an appointment is confirmed. Please read agenda item number 28 and ten. Item 28 cancel 1190 45. Relating to the sale and redevelopment of the former public safety building block, authorizing the execution of an amended receipt of purchase and Sale and Development Agreement with Bozo Development USA LLC for the construction of residential project with public parking, public open space and associated retail space authorizing the acceptance of an easement from Bowser on the property and authorizing Director of Finance Administrative Services to execute documents and take other actions. In connection with this project, the committee recommends that the bill passes, amended with the Divided report with councilmembers Burgess, Herbold, Johnson and O'Brien favoring councilmembers. So want a post from Burgess? Thank you. First of all, I want to start by giving a little history of of this project, which is directly across the street, across Fourth Avenue, where the old public safety headquarters building used to stand. None of us on the city council today or the mayor were involved when the city made a decision in 2007 to allow development of that site, including a civic square plaza. In 2007, when that decision was made. That followed a ten year process where the city engaged with a variety of developers and finally came up with the proposal that was won by Triad development. Due to the Great Recession and other issues, Triad has been unable to develop the project. The city has, since Triad failed, has been involved with four different attempts to find someone who could develop the project. And Bowser Development is the organization that has advanced the proposal that we will consider today. This legislation, if adopted, allows the director of FASB to execute an amended and restated purpose and sale development agreement with Bowser Development. The property formerly known as the Public Safety Building BLOCK. Bowser will construct a single tower residential project on the property, as well as a 25,000 square foot public plaza which the city has the right to approve the design of. Bowser will pay the city $16 million in sale proceeds, which will go to our Equitable Development Initiative. Bowser will pay the city a minimum of $5.7 million for affordable housing. The final amount of this affordable housing payment will be determined once the final design of the residential tower is complete. The project also calls for continuous operation of the Pioneer Square Transit Tunnel Station, which is located beneath this block. The total consideration for the city to receive here is approximately $50 million $16 million in sale proceeds. The minimum contribution of $5.7 million in affordable housing. The release of liability of the city, and the waiver of potential litigation costs. An immediate maintenance requirement. Once this ordinance is adopted by the Council, Bowser will take immediate control and will begin doing maintenance on the walls of the pit across the street. Some of that maintenance is needed almost immediately. The committee recommends that this legislation be adopted. Thank you very much. We want to highlight that there is no intention to shut down the product line. Comments, concerns or questions? Councilmember Johnson just. Wanted to offer a couple of quick things. One of the things that I think was important in my consideration of voting for this is that we also have a project labor agreement. That's one of the conditions of the proposed term and sale and that that project labor agreement has already been sent after. Washington, D.C. was a really great sign for us. The developer has a track record here in Seattle but is still relatively new to the city. So working proactively with our building construction trades to develop a project labor agreement that will bring more apprentices and more individuals to the construction trades, I think is going to be really critical here. That $5.7 million floor that Councilmember Burgess talked about would build at minimum 70 units of affordable housing here in the city and will be larger if it's found that the floor plates for the tower is larger than what was originally proposed by the previous developer. So good options here for us and really looking forward to the final action here this afternoon. Thanks very much for the comments. I'm going to ask the clerk, please call the roll on that. I'm sorry, Councilmember Swan. Thank you, President Herrell. I voted against this council bill in committee and I intend to do so again today. And I would like to take a moment to explain why this vote authorizes the sale of an extremely valuable city property to a big developer for $16 million, which I think would be an estimated at least an estimated $40 million less than its actual value. This sweetheart deal for Seattle's mega developers is nothing new, really. As was mentioned accurately, this property has been sitting idle for the past n\", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to.

Any comments? Those in favor of confirming the appointment. Please vote i. I opposed the motion carries an appointment is confirmed. Please read agenda item number 28 and ten. Item 28 cancel 1190 45. Relating to the sale and redevelopment of the former public safety building block, authorizing the execution of an amended receipt of purchase and Sale and Development Agreement with Bozo Development USA LLC for the construction of residential project with public parking, public open space and associated retail space authorizing the acceptance of an easement from Bowser on the property and authorizing Director of Finance Administrative Services to execute documents and take other actions. In connection with this project, the committee recommends that the bill passes, amended with the Divided report with councilmembers Burgess, Herbold, Johnson and O'Brien favoring councilmembers. So want a post from Burgess? Thank you. First of all, I want to start by giving a little history of of this project, which is directly across the street, across Fourth Avenue, where the old public safety headquarters building used to stand. None of us on the city council today or the mayor were involved when the city made a decision in 2007 to allow development of that site, including a civic square plaza. In 2007, when that decision was made. That followed a ten year process where the city engaged with a variety of developers and finally came up with the proposal that was won by Triad development. Due to the Great Recession and other issues, Triad has been unable to develop the project. The city has, since Triad failed, has been involved with four different attempts to find someone who could develop the project. And Bowser Development is the organization that has advanced the proposal that we will consider today. This legislation, if adopted, allows the director of FASB to execute an amended and restated purpose and sale development agreement with Bowser Development. The property formerly known as the Public Safety Building BLOCK. Bowser will construct a single tower residential project on the property, as well as a 25,000 square foot public plaza which the city has the right to approve the design of. Bowser will pay the city $16 million in sale proceeds, which will go to our Equitable Development Initiative. Bowser will pay the city a minimum of $5.7 million for affordable housing. The final amount of this affordable housing payment will be determined once the final design of the residential tower is complete. The project also calls for continuous operation of the Pioneer Square Transit Tunnel Station, which is located beneath this block. The total consideration for the city to receive here is approximately $50 million $16 million in sale proceeds. The minimum contribution of $5.7 million in affordable housing. The release of liability of the city, and the waiver of potential litigation costs. An immediate maintenance requirement. Once this ordinance is adopted by the Council, Bowser will take immediate control and will begin doing maintenance on the walls of the pit across the street. Some of that maintenance is needed almost immediately. The committee recommends that this legislation be adopted. Thank you very much. We want to highlight that there is no intention to shut down the product line. Comments, concerns or questions? Councilmember Johnson just. Wanted to offer a couple of quick things. One of the things that I think was important in my consideration of voting for this is that we also have a project labor agreement. That's one of the conditions of the proposed term and sale and that that project labor agreement has already been sent after. Washington, D.C. was a really great sign for us. The developer has a track record here in Seattle but is still relatively new to the city. So working proactively with our building construction trades to develop a project labor agreement that will bring more apprentices and more individuals to the construction trades, I think is going to be really critical here. That $5.7 million floor that Councilmember Burgess talked about would build at minimum 70 units of affordable housing here in the city and will be larger if it's found that the floor plates for the tower is larger than what was originally proposed by the previous developer. So good options here for us and really looking forward to the final action here this afternoon. Thanks very much for the comments. I'm going to ask the clerk, please call the roll on that. I'm sorry, Councilmember Swan. Thank you, President Herrell. I voted against this council bill in committee and I intend to do so again today. And I would like to take a moment to explain why this vote authorizes the sale of an extremely valuable city property to a big developer for $16 million, which I think would be an estimated at least an estimated $40 million less than its actual value. This sweetheart deal for Seattle's mega developers is nothing new, really. As was mentioned accurately, this property has been sitting idle for the past n\", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to. And worse yet, the public doesn't know what we're talking about or any background to this either. So that's at least an item I'd like to reserve to discuss whether, since we're all members of the City Council, that if we want to have something considered, we should at least have to go through the council referral process. But I know Vice Mayor matters. You want to speak on the Open House proposal? I actually have a similar concern. Is that. We don't have any detail on.

Item number six, please. Communication from Council on Mango Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilman super novice Mary Andrews recommendation to discuss and enact related strategic planning initiatives with youth sports leagues in preparation for re-opening our parks to youth sports activities. Thank you. I appreciate everyone who signed on to this item. As many know, our youth sports programs are many nonprofit organizations and some are many businesses. They employ people who are coaches or referees, and they also have many, many volunteers and parents that participate in keeping the kids out and about and engaged in athletics, which keeps them healthy and strong. So we need to have a focus on ensuring that we are prepared to take on the challenge ahead of allowing multiple sports who are typically spread over a year to really prepare to come back and potentially play simultaneously. An example of this is some of our sports fields overlap each other and we wouldn't be able to in some facilities throughout the city, host both soccer and baseball at the same time. But there are adjustments that can be made throughout the city to make those types of things possible. So when and if sports can come back, we are prepared to give all youth the opportunity to get out there and practice their skills so as they move through and participate in their school sports, they have those knowledge, skills and abilities and talents to really help them through and keep them engaged in their schoolwork. So I really appreciate the youth sports directors that have reached out with you on better understanding your goals. And I think it's important to have a formal process where Parks and Rec really sits with the directors and casting directors that know and understand the complexities that can come about as we roll out the new requirements, which organizations are really prepared to do to meet that challenge and for them to be able to share ideas with people that aren't yet getting that kind of guidance from their national association? Councilman Supernormal. Thank you. And if that was the motion, I'd like to second the motion and just add to it that I fully support this and thank Councilmember Mongo for bringing it forward. We have the good fortune of having some baseball leagues in the fourth district, Durant Park Post, Long Beach League, Whaley Post, Long Beach Pro Baseball, and then where the North has a number of volleyball teams. Our council district has invested a lot into these facilities. We support them tremendously, and we'd really like to see them get going once again. Also to reiterate what Councilman Mungo stated, and that is these organizations can bring their own protocols to the table. So let's make sure we we listen to them as we move forward. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you so much. I appreciate I appreciate bringing this item forward. And I have kids who are in their youth programs in the city, both the city sponsored ones and also club ones. And I really do think we need to sit down and figure out how to work on protocols that make participation in these activities safe and feasible for our youth. I can say that as a parent of two children who have been out of school now for since March and entering into the summer, there is a lot of downtime for them. And I think team sports and sports activities that we're able to reintegrate into our daily lives will assist them tremendously in getting outdoors, exercising, staying healthy, making good choices, interacting with people outside of the technology world that they're most of them are operating in. And so anything that we can do as a city to help partner with these organizations to allow for safe reopening and participation, I would support and I appreciate Cassell and Mongo bringing this item forward. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Austin. Thank you. I just want to add my my my support to this item. Obviously, youth sports are extremely important and I really think it's part of the DNA of this city. So when we get back to functionality, we should have a plan to ensure that that our youth are safe, their parents are safe, and that they are having an enriched activity, whatever sport they are playing, either super active sports or not. And so I think there are also a lot of national organizations that are connected to many of these sports organizations that they can draw upon information as well. Our staff can draw upon information as well. But I do like the idea of working with local youth organizations, sports organizations throughout the city to to be engaged in the process, at least as as important stakeholders in the process. So congratulations. I really like this item and plan on supporting it. Council member Adam Quirk. Any public comment? Yes. We do have public comment on this item. Joel Davis. Um, you have 3 minutes. I may regret not to thank you for hearing this agenda item and allow it. My name is Joel. There's a current president o\", \"One, two. We're going to move on to our our our first our study session that we have scheduled tonight, which is actually a pretty important one. And so I just want to just give everyone just a minute to kind of a shake off their tiredness as we go into it here. But we're going to go we're going to go right into this first and then into the study session, and we'll then we'll continue the rest of the agenda. So our staff are going to give you I'll give you guys a minute to get set up. We can please load the presentation. The team. Carrie. Ready to go? Okay. Let me let me just make a couple opening remarks and we'll get right into it. Just I want to say that this is I know going to be, I believe, part one of a of a two part major presentation on ah, the state of our streets and the payment management plan that this council has been working very hard on ensuring that we implement. There has been a lot of excitement around infrastructure. I also want to add that the city is and has embarked on its largest infrastructure plan and street plan that we've had in probably 40 or 50 years. And so the amount of dollars that are going into our streets over the course of the next decade is significant. It's it's, of course, thanks in large part to the support of the voters with measure. It's also because of legislation that's gone that's come down the pipeline that's increasing our ability to to improve local streets. And so we are we're grateful that we're also grateful that Measure M, which was also passed by the voters, also adds to this to this pot. And so it's a incredible opportunity for us. This report, I think, is very important for the council to understand kind of where we are, what are pavement, what our street patterns look like, where we're going. And then and then moving on, we'll have we have some good questions. And so I would encourage the council to engage on this topic because it's it's very important. With that. Mr.. West Mayor, councilmembers members. You're absolutely right. This is a tremendously important topic that we're going to review tonight. In 2015, the council authorized us to begin a RFP to hire a company that would do a pavement management plan for us. That pavement management plan has done and I'm going to turn this over to our public works director, Craig Beck, and also our traffic engineer and deputy director of Public Works, Sean Crumby. And they are going to talk about the pavement management plan and our alley management plan as well. So, Craig. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. We are excited to. Bring forward. Tonight an updated pavement management plan, as the manager indicated. The council first adopted a pavement management plan back in 2015. It is best practice for city organizations, especially cities the size of Long Beach, to go through and update their pumps on a every 2 to 3 year basis. So we're back before you here this evening to provide you with an update and to go over what is the conditions of our street in the city. This is a. Prelude to kind of kicking off. The budget season, if. You will. We believe that the CHP program is an important element of the budget. As I know, council also supports that. And within the capital improvement program or CHP, streets will be a major category of expense. So again, tonight, we're going to go over the elements of of the condition of our streets. And the next time we come forward in part two, we will talk specifically about the amount of funding we have available and where we're making recommendations to prioritize that funding. So with that, I would ask our city engineer, deputy director Sean Crumby to go through the details of the presentation. Creating on our mayor and council. It's great to be here tonight. The presentation, as was mentioned, is going to focus on the state of the city streets and in particular what's been going on in the last few years. How do I fast forward? Can we get the presentation on the screens in front of us? Just to take services, please. Because it's not. Also, we're. Not able to advance the slides. Okay. So having some tech difficulties we need we built the slides to work and for us to be able to see it on the screens. Thank you. Okay. So what is pavement management? Pavement management is it's a process, a formal process where the city inventories, catalogs, inspects and prioritizes the repairs that will happen throughout the city in the most fiscally prudent manner. It's not just good practice. It's also people may not realize that most of the funding that comes into this program is through transportation funding, and a lot of that funding requires our pavement management. As was mentioned, best practice is every 2 to 3 years. And so this report seeks to come and do that. So pavement management rates every street in the city with a score called the Pavement Condition Index or PCI. The square starts at a high value of 100 for new streets and goes do\", \"Okay. Thank you. Next step is item 14. You know. I'm sorry, Adam. 15. Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to direct city manager to work with the fire chief to present a report on the status of one beaches Hart and 30 days. Go ahead. Thank you. I have done this in previous years. Doing this before the budget cycle is kind of what we do. This was one of the very first. Items that I was able to help usher through the budget process in my very first year on council, the Hart Team has been an organization that has helped augment some of our calls for those that are experiencing homelessness, as well as mental health challenges. I know in previous years we've had videos and great reports. I'm curious on the numbers and statistics about how the Hart team is working. I know that one of the Hart teams is able to respond to 911 calls. Would like to be able to understand that a little bit more how that's working out. And so I know it's a tight turnaround. I did check in with the fire chief ahead of this. And so I feel pretty confident about it and hope that my council colleagues will support this item. Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Rice. Mr. Mayor, I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this item forward and for including me on this item. And I just I am incredibly grateful for the program and everything that we have accomplished, especially when we're talking about things like social services and creative ways of addressing these common issues. And so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a report back. Vice Mayor Andres. Thank you very much. First of all, I think this is this item is a wonderful idea. I believe that we should board up these conversations and discuss online portals so everyone can access and connect this data, data and data from public outreach teams as well. You know, there's nothing more frustrating to a resident than calling to report a person experiencing homelessness and not receiving follow up, sometimes due to hyper or other factors. Information cannot be shared. But even if we could just sheer numbers like these, it would be a great, great idea. Thank you very much. Okay. Public comment, please. There's no public comment on this item. Thank you, Rocco. District one. My district to. I was district three. By. District four. At my. District five. I. District six. I. District seven. I.

So when and if sports can come back, we are prepared to give all youth the opportunity to get out there and practice their skills so as they move through and participate in their school sports, they have those knowledge, skills and abilities and talents to really help them through and keep them engaged in their schoolwork. So I really appreciate the youth sports directors that have reached out with you on better understanding your goals. And I think it's important to have a formal process where Parks and Rec really sits with the directors and casting directors that know and understand the complexities that can come about as we roll out the new requirements, which organizations are really prepared to do to meet that challenge and for them to be able to share ideas with people that aren't yet getting that kind of guidance from their national association? Councilman Supernormal. Thank you. And if that was the motion, I'd like to second the motion and just add to it that I fully support this and thank Councilmember Mongo for bringing it forward. We have the good fortune of having some baseball leagues in the fourth district, Durant Park Post, Long Beach League, Whaley Post, Long Beach Pro Baseball, and then where the North has a number of volleyball teams. Our council district has invested a lot into these facilities. We support them tremendously, and we'd really like to see them get going once again. Also to reiterate what Councilman Mungo stated, and that is these organizations can bring their own protocols to the table. So let's make sure we we listen to them as we move forward. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you so much. I appreciate I appreciate bringing this item forward. And I have kids who are in their youth programs in the city, both the city sponsored ones and also club ones. And I really do think we need to sit down and figure out how to work on protocols that make participation in these activities safe and feasible for our youth. I can say that as a parent of two children who have been out of school now for since March and entering into the summer, there is a lot of downtime for them. And I think team sports and sports activities that we're able to reintegrate into our daily lives will assist them tremendously in getting outdoors, exercising, staying healthy, making good choices, interacting with people outside of the technology world that they're most of them are operating in. And so anything that we can do as a city to help partner with these organizations to allow for safe reopening and participation, I would support and I appreciate Cassell and Mongo bringing this item forward. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Austin. Thank you. I just want to add my my my support to this item. Obviously, youth sports are extremely important and I really think it's part of the DNA of this city. So when we get back to functionality, we should have a plan to ensure that that our youth are safe, their parents are safe, and that they are having an enriched activity, whatever sport they are playing, either super active sports or not. And so I think there are also a lot of national organizations that are connected to many of these sports organizations that they can draw upon information as well. Our staff can draw upon information as well. But I do like the idea of working with local youth organizations, sports organizations throughout the city to to be engaged in the process, at least as as important stakeholders in the process. So congratulations. I really like this item and plan on supporting it. Council member Adam Quirk. Any public comment? Yes. We do have public comment on this item. Joel Davis. Um, you have 3 minutes. I may regret not to thank you for hearing this agenda item and allow it. My name is Joel. There's a current president o\", \"One, two. We're going to move on to our our our first our study session that we have scheduled tonight, which is actually a pretty important one. And so I just want to just give everyone just a minute to kind of a shake off their tiredness as we go into it here. But we're going to go we're going to go right into this first and then into the study session, and we'll then we'll continue the rest of the agenda. So our staff are going to give you I'll give you guys a minute to get set up. We can please load the presentation. The team. Carrie. Ready to go? Okay. Let me let me just make a couple opening remarks and we'll get right into it. Just I want to say that this is I know going to be, I believe, part one of a of a two part major presentation on ah, the state of our streets and the payment management plan that this council has been working very hard on ensuring that we implement. There has been a lot of excitement around infrastructure. I also want to add that the city is and has embarked on its largest infrastructure plan and street plan that we've had in probably 40 or 50 years. And so the amount of dollars that are going into our streets over the course of the next decade is significant. It's it's, of course, thanks in large part to the support of the voters with measure. It's also because of legislation that's gone that's come down the pipeline that's increasing our ability to to improve local streets. And so we are we're grateful that we're also grateful that Measure M, which was also passed by the voters, also adds to this to this pot. And so it's a incredible opportunity for us. This report, I think, is very important for the council to understand kind of where we are, what are pavement, what our street patterns look like, where we're going. And then and then moving on, we'll have we have some good questions. And so I would encourage the council to engage on this topic because it's it's very important. With that. Mr.. West Mayor, councilmembers members. You're absolutely right. This is a tremendously important topic that we're going to review tonight. In 2015, the council authorized us to begin a RFP to hire a company that would do a pavement management plan for us. That pavement management plan has done and I'm going to turn this over to our public works director, Craig Beck, and also our traffic engineer and deputy director of Public Works, Sean Crumby. And they are going to talk about the pavement management plan and our alley management plan as well. So, Craig. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. We are excited to. Bring forward. Tonight an updated pavement management plan, as the manager indicated. The council first adopted a pavement management plan back in 2015. It is best practice for city organizations, especially cities the size of Long Beach, to go through and update their pumps on a every 2 to 3 year basis. So we're back before you here this evening to provide you with an update and to go over what is the conditions of our street in the city. This is a. Prelude to kind of kicking off. The budget season, if. You will. We believe that the CHP program is an important element of the budget. As I know, council also supports that. And within the capital improvement program or CHP, streets will be a major category of expense. So again, tonight, we're going to go over the elements of of the condition of our streets. And the next time we come forward in part two, we will talk specifically about the amount of funding we have available and where we're making recommendations to prioritize that funding. So with that, I would ask our city engineer, deputy director Sean Crumby to go through the details of the presentation. Creating on our mayor and council. It's great to be here tonight. The presentation, as was mentioned, is going to focus on the state of the city streets and in particular what's been going on in the last few years. How do I fast forward? Can we get the presentation on the screens in front of us? Just to take services, please. Because it's not. Also, we're. Not able to advance the slides. Okay. So having some tech difficulties we need we built the slides to work and for us to be able to see it on the screens. Thank you. Okay. So what is pavement management? Pavement management is it's a process, a formal process where the city inventories, catalogs, inspects and prioritizes the repairs that will happen throughout the city in the most fiscally prudent manner. It's not just good practice. It's also people may not realize that most of the funding that comes into this program is through transportation funding, and a lot of that funding requires our pavement management. As was mentioned, best practice is every 2 to 3 years. And so this report seeks to come and do that. So pavement management rates every street in the city with a score called the Pavement Condition Index or PCI. The square starts at a high value of 100 for new streets and goes do\", \"Okay. Thank you. Next step is item 14. You know. I'm sorry, Adam. 15. Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to direct city manager to work with the fire chief to present a report on the status of one beaches Hart and 30 days. Go ahead. Thank you. I have done this in previous years. Doing this before the budget cycle is kind of what we do. This was one of the very first. Items that I was able to help usher through the budget process in my very first year on council, the Hart Team has been an organization that has helped augment some of our calls for those that are experiencing homelessness, as well as mental health challenges. I know in previous years we've had videos and great reports. I'm curious on the numbers and statistics about how the Hart team is working. I know that one of the Hart teams is able to respond to 911 calls. Would like to be able to understand that a little bit more how that's working out. And so I know it's a tight turnaround. I did check in with the fire chief ahead of this. And so I feel pretty confident about it and hope that my council colleagues will support this item. Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Rice. Mr. Mayor, I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this item forward and for including me on this item. And I just I am incredibly grateful for the program and everything that we have accomplished, especially when we're talking about things like social services and creative ways of addressing these common issues. And so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a report back. Vice Mayor Andres. Thank you very much. First of all, I think this is this item is a wonderful idea. I believe that we should board up these conversations and discuss online portals so everyone can access and connect this data, data and data from public outreach teams as well. You know, there's nothing more frustrating to a resident than calling to report a person experiencing homelessness and not receiving follow up, sometimes due to hyper or other factors. Information cannot be shared. But even if we could just sheer numbers like these, it would be a great, great idea. Thank you very much. Okay. Public comment, please.

I'm Libby Adams with Community Planning and Development. And I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment at 4710 North Stuart Street. This application is located in Council District one in the Berkeley neighborhood, and the applicant is. Requesting to rezone. From you, as you see to you as you see one to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. As stated previously, the current zoning is urban single unit C, which allows the Urban House building form on a minimum size of 5500 square feet. The existing land use is a single unit home and this slide shows the existing building performance scale with the subject property on the upper right hand side. A postcard notifying neighboring property owners was sent out on March 24th, and then the planning board unanimously recommended approval of the rezoning on May 18th. And to date, staff has not received any comments from members of the public. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria that must be met in order for rezoning to be approved. The first is consistency with adopted plans, and there are two plans that are applicable to this rezoning. You can find more information on how this rezoning meets the strategies of a comprehensive plan in the staff report. I'll just focus on Blueprint Denver. So the. Future neighborhood context and Blueprint Denver's urban. And then the future place type is identified as low residential. And these are areas where ads are appropriate. And then the future street type for North Stuart Street is local and these are mostly characterized by residential uses, also consistent with the request. The Growth Area Strategy and blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. And then. Blueprint also has specific. Policy guidance. So the land use and built form housing policy four talks about diversifying housing choice by allowing aid use throughout all of our residential areas. Staff also finds the rezoning meets the next two criteria. It will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing our adopted plans and providing a new type of housing unit in a largely single unit area. And there's also a justifying circumstance in the adopted language and Blueprint Denver about its use in all of our residential areas. And then lastly. This proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context. The residential districts purpose and then the specific intent of the US. You see one zoned district. So finding all five criteria have been met. Staff recommends approval of this rezoning. Thank you, Libby. We do not have any speakers signed up to speak on this item this evening.

The required public hearing for Council Bill 1365 is open. May we have the staff report? Good evening, council. I'm Jenny Guttenberg, senior city planner, community planning and Development. I'm also here with my colleague Becca Dyer Show, who is learning the ropes of our historic designation process and whom you'll be seeing more of in the future. She may assist me tonight with any design review questions that you might have for this historic district proposal. We are considering 19 properties on the east side of the 607 hundred blocks of North Steel Street in the Congress Park neighborhood. This is a new historic district proposal, not an amendment to the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons that you see listed on the screen. This application was submitted by three property owners who live within the boundaries of the proposed district. They spent the last two years developing the application and reaching out to other property owners to inform, educate and solicit their support for the proposal. The owners. Applicants of this district designation are Ken Fuller, Jane Pretzel and Tom Heath. The district is located within the Congress Park neighborhood and includes 19 primary structures 18 that are contributing. This is within Council District ten and blueprints under the areas within the urban neighborhood context and low residential area. Future place type. Current zoning is USAC. This is a dis contiguous historic district in two separate sections and was done in this way to avoid overlapping with the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district boundary. You can see by this map that a major justification for creating this new historic district is to include both the east and west sides of the 607 100 block of North Steele Street. The east side was left out of the 1993 East Seventh Avenue Historic District designation. This proposed district stands on its own with a period of significance from 1912 to 1990, while the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district has a period of significance prior to and including 1943. The proposed district meets all landmarks preservation ordinance designation criteria. It maintains its integrity. It is more than 30 years old. It meets three of the ten significance criteria. And it provides a historic context for consideration by the Landmark Preservation Commission. I want to mention the design review requirement for designated properties. Over the past several months, Landmark Preservation Staff engage property owners within the proposed district to clearly explain the design guidelines and design review process, including two community meetings, one in August 2021 and another in October 2021, as well as email communications with individuals. One of the major responsibilities of property owner who owns a historically designated property is to maintain its historic character. When a property is designated, it is designated as is and requires no improvements by the city. Maintaining a property's historic character is achieved through Landmark Preservation Design Review for any exterior alterations that require a zoning or \", \"Tonight, we have three public hearings for those participating in person.

It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-2 46 is open. May we please have the staff report? Good afternoon, members of City Council. My name is Frank Benefield, Senior City Planning. Senior city planner with planning services. And today I'm going to present an overview of the MAP Amendment for 2039 South William Street. Subject property is in Council District six in the university neighborhood. The request is to resume to a district that will allow for any review of the rear of the property or other forms, and new standard standards will remain the same. The property is currently in the urban single unit season district, which is in dislocate in this location, would only allow for the Urban House building for a minimum size of 5500 square feet. And as you can see on the map, the property surrounded by other properties. Also shown us, you see there is a little bit of our age, 2.5, half a block to the east. And you can see some in is three half a block to a cell. The current land use it aside a single unit residential and it is mostly surrounded by other single unit uses. There is some two unit uses to the north and you can see the land use map that the University of Denver campus is only a block and a half a block, east and east Berry Elementary School is three blocks to the west. This light here shows that the subject property is on the bottom right and gives you an idea of the residential character of the neighborhood. Now speaking to the process. Information on notice of the application was sent on December 27th, 2021. Planning Board recommended approval anonymously on February 16, 2022, and to date, staff has received only one letter of opposition from the University Neighbors Neighborhood Association, expressing concerns with the potential increase of number of residents, vehicles and pets. This proposal could bring. The letter refers to this request for a variance and mentions the Board of Adjustments. An email was sent to the R.A. to try and clarify that this is a rezoning process and not a variance. Now moving onto Denver zoning code review criteria, it must be found that the request map amendment is consistent with the five criteria. The first criterion is consistency with the plans. There are two plans applicable to the rezoning Comprehensive Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context in Denver. And the future places map the signal US designates as a slow residential place. Displaced types have predominantly single and two unit uses, and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. William Street is designated as a local street, which are mostly characterized by residential use. Lupine includes also includes specific policy recommendations. Housing policy for focuses on diversifying housing choice through expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas.

So really, the city's discretion here is simply the design of the building. The planning board had a study session in October of 2018 to just to review the overall design of the building, the size, its compliance with the zoning code to make sure it met all of our zoning requirements. And then two months later, they had another public hearing and approved the project in December of 2018. That decision was then appealed by the neighbors of the project. The City Council held a hearing on February 5th, considered the appeal, considered the Planning Board's decision, and upheld the Planning Board's decision. That decision that the Planning Board made to approve the project had two remaining items that the Planning Board had asked the applicant to do, which one was to come back with final architectural design elements for the building. So the scale, size, height was all approved, but they wanted to get more details and an articulation on the building . So they asked the applicant to come back with that. They also wanted more detail and some fine tuning to the landscape plan. The City Council, at your hearing after upholding the planning board, said, Yeah, we absolutely agree. Planning Board, you should keep working on those two items. And we would also like you to take one last look at the setback of the building from the water and consider pushing it back ten or 15 feet. You didn't tell them to do it. You asked them to just consider whether that was a good idea or not. Two days later, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, a board of Directors Board of Commissioners, held a public hearing to discuss this very same project and determined that it was completely consistent with their guidelines, standards and rules, and that it met their set back requirements and provided an appropriate set back to the water from Bccdc perspective. We then followed that up with two neighborhood meetings. Then on May 28th, the planning board held another public hearing, and at that meeting they considered the staff recommendation, which at that point was to not move the building back any further. We did not feel that we should push the building closer, push it back away from the water, because we felt the distance from the water was appropriate. And equally important, we felt that to push it back towards the neighbors would simply make the building appear even taller. So and there was at the neighborhood meetings on February 16th and May 11th that we had had prior to May 28th, there was no no support and no requests from the neighbors to pull the building back towards them. So we made that recommendation at May 28th. The planning board did not get any public speakers asking that the building get pushed back towards the neighborhood and they approved. The building setback. That decision was then appealed. And that's the one of the decisions you're considering tonight. But they did not approve the final designs and the final landscape at that at that meeting. We then had two more community meetings. And then on July 22nd, the planning board reaffirmed and re-approved the project setback and the final architectural details and lighting. So this is a project that the planning board has worked very hard on. And as I said earlier, we feel they they made the right decision. The appellant makes three arguments. One is there weren't enough community meetings. The planning board is required to have notice public hearings. They held those public hearings there. They completely fulfilled the requirements of the zoning code in terms of public meetings. All of the extra neighborhood meetings I just talked about were extra meetings. So there is no requirement for any more meetings. The other two issues related to the appeal are about the setback of the building. What this slide shows you is a couple of things. The the orange area shown is the footprint of the building in December. And if you look very closely, you'll see there's a there's another footprint sort of superimposed on the orange. You can see that is the final footprint. It was approved by the planning board. So you can see if you look very closely, the building got ever so slightly longer. It got a little narrower in places on the width, but the basic set back never changed. The reason the the configuration changed slightly is we were working with the applicant and the planning board was working on the applicant and the neighbors were working with the opinion to get more articulation into the design. So the design sort of you got some more ins and outs, more reveals the overall design of the building improved over this period. The actual square footage remained basically the same. The actual location of the building remained the same. We didn't move it back, as I said earlier. The another thing that has not changed is this relationship of the set back to to the waterfront. So we didn't move the building back. The thing that I'll just point out here is the requirement \", \"Good evening, Mayor. I am Ninette Mercado and from the Community Development Department. As was stated, as has been a topic before the council in three closed sessions and tonight is its second time in the public. At the April 2nd City Council meeting, the Council received a public presentation of the proposed lease with Nautilus Data Technologies for the public. Nautilus Data Technologies uses innovative water cooling technology to operate data centers that reduce the costs of computing power usage, eliminate water consumption, decrease air pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions. This would be their first site for this technology. And so it's it's a cutting edge technology at that meeting. At the April 2nd meeting, Nautilus provided an overview of its project, but consultants related to its proposed technology. Environmental engineers who would lead the permitting process and the consultant we use to locate and construct the harbor seal haul out advised them and spoke about the project's input . Our impact on the SEALs. In addition, there was a representative from the trade unions and a high tech tenant from Alameda Point who spoke in support of the project. The council asked to postpone the decision on the lease until the city had an opportunity to discuss the Site B development project and any impact Nobelist might have on the development. During the tour, the broker pointed out that we crafted and and novelis accepted a smaller parcel to allow for a greater development opportunity for site B. So tonight we're returning to ask for lease approval for for this lease for a term of 15 years with two five year options, which was negotiated as a result of council direction. The tenant has agreed to pay a development impact fee, also requested by the Council for a total of $1,562,971. At filled out, the project will contribute one and a half to two and a half million dollars in revenue for Alameda Municipal Power, which will help AMP keep rates low for residents. I hope that tonight you will consider this recommendation and support the lease approval. Thank you. The applicant is here if you're. Any questions that you might have for them. Thank you. Okay. Council. Question. Council Member Vice Mayor Nothing like this. I'm not sure this might be my first vote. This requires four votes. Yes. So I guess my question is, before we have any conversation, it seems like there have been a number of council members who have voiced strong concerns about this. If there are two or more of those, I think in the idea of expediency. I would love to know if there are people who are concerned not going to have talking. We can we can take a straw poll. Does anyone have any questions they want answered? However. Odie. I'll wait to the straw poll. I mean, I do. But it's not. You want a straw poll to asking any question? It would just be to reinforce my opinion. So maybe I'm not going to ask them. Why? Well, I should. Be honest about it. So. So. Well, for one, I'm not ready to vote because I want to hear council's discussion. But if you I mean, do people. You mean do people truly know how to vote now, how they're going to vote now? Councilmember De So you look quizzical, I'll say. Yeah, well, I'm kind of quizzical because I know that for the most part I've been quite supportive of this project and I don't see any reason to change my mind. Since we first discussed this, at least I first discussed this in the closed door, largely because I like the impact, their contribution into the into the feet. So it's not the 100% fee, but it's. But at 1 million plus, it is something. So the developer. Devoting. 40% of their to. That. I know that I could just speak for myself that, you know, I will continue to be supportive of this project. Okay. Councilmember de SAC Gleaning Support. Vice Mayor. I you know, I would want to have a conversation about some monitoring and and outcomes of the monitoring issues that I think would be problematic for the applicant. But I think if we could get there, it's a project that I could potentially support. Okay. Leaning support. Um, yeah. Councilmember Vela asked me to. Just logistically, it's easier. She goes last in the comments, but are you ready to comment? Well, I was skeptical before, and I'm still skeptical, even more so based on the tour that we did a couple weeks ago. Okay. Leaning skeptical. Councilmember Vela, who's going to come to us over the say? Are you there, Councilmember Vela? Yeah. Here you are. Hi. So you followed that. We're taking just a little informal straw poll here. I still have some outstanding questions. I think I think they're you know, the thing right now, I think, um, you know, potentially could be helpful to our conversation. Well, I think I think probably. And then questions regarding the the police. Um. And, uh, including the length of it and. The actual what was something about the lease? The term actual term lease? Got it. Okay. So is it you could be persuaded.

This includes things that I will say I have heard from the community or Tony and I have heard from the community. But again, most that most of this is mine or from other council members during the election, etc. This is a proposed potential list of things we could say yes or no to. So it isn't we are not necessarily proposing we run forward with all of this. But Tony and I really wanted to come back to this body and say, hey, before we spend any time working on this stuff, what do we want to work on it? So I thought it would be helpful because I think there's only one or maybe two things on here that are my own personal like things that I threw on here of going through and kind of talking about where where these things came from so that there's a little bit more understanding that it's not. John just going completely wild districts and ranked choice voting have come up districts came up at a community meeting that Tony and I attended in I believe it was December the Alameda Citizens Task Force meeting ranked choice voting is something that has come from a variety of Alameda progressives, the element, Green Party, etc. The different groups there have talked about that direct elect the mayor is something I've been talking about for about a year and a half or so, which is the idea that we changed at one point in time from what what some cities have, which is we elect city council and then the city council, like the school board, adopts or appoints a mayor. And oftentimes that mayor rotates once a once a year. So I think that there are some benefits to that, especially with the way we do boards and commissions, etc.. So if there was interest, we could look at that. Term limits, definitely. Something has come up both in the community and I've heard members of this body talk about that with everything that's been going on lately, whether it's Measure K or Measures B or yeah, the Sun Cow Initiative and whatever else, this idea of charter charter ballot initiatives and paid signature gatherers and looking at what we know. First question, is the charter the right place for any of this? But is there something we could do in the charter that might require not just spending a lot of money to tell people something they want to hear, even though they don't understand what they're being asked to sign necessarily. Campaign finance reform is definitely something that came up in it through the campaign for me, but has been coming up for at least ten years in conversations I've had. Removing housing restrictions, measure a and moving that language to the municipal code. That was both a staff recommendation and things. I've heard members of this body say that they were interested in discussing and looking at board and commission appointments. There was discussion at one point in time, actually at the city council about four years ago about possibly changing it. It didn't get three votes to move forward, but I figured I would throw that out there. And then the question is, are all the right boards and commissions in this? Tony is proposed finance commission and whatever else the Open Government Commission is, that's something that should be in the charter. Are these the right ones? I just wanted to, since we're having this conversation, say now would be a great time to consider this. And then lastly, and this is I'm going to say we have we heard slightly two different takes on what this could mean. And that's why it was written the way it was clarifying county council interference. And Tony, I think has some interest in this item, so I'll let you talk about that one. But we also the city received an independent report that suggested that we look at changing the charter language to clarify what interference is as well, looking at the removal of the auditor and treasurer. So we made changes in 2008. We've made some changes through the years of what the auditor and the Treasurer is. You know, I've definitely heard many multiple people suggest that and I have also been one of those people suggest that they don't need to be elected officials. They do very, very little work actually. They spend a lot of time. But the actual their actual jobs are just a few hours a year for the most part. It's not clear why. It's clear why they used to exist, because they used to actually have a whole workload. But we now have a professional staff that does most of the work and they basically just sign off on most of it. So the question is, why are we electing these two positions and what are they bringing? Council pay has definitely been something that's not just me, definitely something that that former council people have talked about for many years. If we want to have a broad breadth of people who run for and tried to be on the city council, we can't assume that everybody can afford to give up 20 hours a week for $100 every two weeks. No, sorry. A month. Sorry. I just a\", \"Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to our our study session then, and which we have scheduled today, which is a big staff presentation. I want to I'm going to open it up and let me know, Mr. Modica, when you guys are set up and ready. We're ready. Okay, great. We have actually let me go in first. Do you want to read the city section into the record, please? Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive and file a presentation on efforts related to the Clean Language Initiative. Thank you. And I am thankful I've been talking to staff about bringing this study session forward. And it's something that I know is not just important to me, but it's important to everybody on this dais. And we've been talking about this for as long as we've all been, I think, together as part of this body, the cleanliness of the city and ensuring that neighborhoods, regardless of where they're located across across the city, are clean and well maintained is incredibly important. I also want to make sure that I think we're all aware that during the pandemic, the the impact of the pandemic had on cleanliness was was serious. And we have gone through a health recovery. We're going through an economic recovery and making sure that we also recover so that neighborhoods have the streets sweeping on time, that trash is being picked appropriately, that dumped items are being are being picked up when they need to be. The corridors are being cleaned up is also really important when you think about a year and a half now where you had much of your staff or many staff members, whether they were sick or they weren't able to go do certain certain functions of their job. It did impact cleanliness when you had more homes producing more waste. That also impacts cleanliness. And when you have different patterns of travel, that also impacts cleanliness. When folks from your from from certain departments are unable to do certain work because they're out working at getting folks healthy or vaccinated or tested, that also impacts the work that we can do as a city around cleanliness. So we have had a difficult year and a half, but I'm really proud of the staff, is doing a great job of bringing this back and I look forward to hearing the presentation. We want to make sure that Long Beach is is a clean community for everyone that is here. And I know there's going to be a lot of questions. I have some as well that I'll I'll ask of you guys as soon as the presentation is over. I want to thank you guys for the work that you that you did with this and the memo that you sent to council earlier today. And I view this as a very important initiative for the team and for the staff as we move forward across this next year. So, Mr. Modica. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. That was a very good overview. We are going to have a presentation that kind of has three parts today. We're going to talk about a lot of the investment that this Mayor and council have made over the past four or five years. It's been impressive considering where we started. We didn't really have this kind of clean language program. We created it and just about every year we added to it. Every year, though, we kept getting more and more requests. So the better we did, the more requests we got for our service. And you'll see that today. Do you asked us to do probably 20 to 5 different initiatives as part of that over the years. We're going to report on those today. Almost all of those are complete or we're going to be getting to a lot of those or a couple of more of those as we do the Recovery Act. We're also going to go through some of the data of what it's looked like over the last year. That was one of the strangest years we've had from a from a refuge perspective. And the mayor mentioned a, well, just patterns changed and demand changed and the team really had to adapt to keep up with it. And then we're going to talk about what's next. We have for at least two years, we have some dedicated resources to really invest and do things we've never been able to do before. So I will turn it over to Eric Lopez, to Nico Mokonyane and to Chris Coons, who I'm sorry, Chris Hubert, who will go through the presentation. Thank you, Tom. I want to reiterate that maintaining a clean city is one of our department's highest priorities. We have heard loud and clear that this is a priority for the mayor and the city council, and it's a priority for us as well. So we've throughout the years, we have built a strong, clean team that continues to improve and evolve. And the present presentation today, I think, is going to demonstrate some of that evolution and some of the improvements that that we continue to make. So with that, wanted to turn it over to Decode McClennan, our deputy director. Go. Good evening, everybody. Thank you for having us here tonight to give this presentation. We're eager to. Share with you some of the challenges we face and some of the some of the successes we have had and anticipate. So\", \"Motion carries. Item 2711. Communication from city attorney recommendation to adopt a resolution acknowledging racism as a public health crisis and establishing a framework for reconciliation citywide. Gave a motion by Councilmember Richardson and a second by Councilmember Pearce. We got a public comment, please. There's one public comment for this item. Dave Shukla, your time begins now. Oh. Hello. Sorry. The bloody bishop. This is a very important item. It. Yeah. I mean, I can't stress that enough as someone who the only enemy he has is a hundred years of carbon trapped in the. It's kind of easy to attract content. But for everyone's lived experience right now, there are all the decisions that were made tonight, made from a place of lack of knowledge about how they'll affect certain groups more than others. And a lot of the unintended consequences that we hear about from public policy discussions, we need to kind of fill that in in the 21st century . We need to kind of look at the data that we have so many different events, but but specifically on how certain groups of people. How you have their freedoms as a result of keeping other people unfree. That's not what this country should be about. Thank you very much. Black Lives Matter. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item. Councilman Richardson, you want to speak to the motion there? A few thoughts on that. Some are just some changes here. So first, I want to just acknowledge Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Pierce, who all signed on to the initial recommendation that started this on this framework reconciliation path. We've had two meetings, the last meeting, and it's one in 55 people in the listening session. I think it was in terms of listening sessions go, it was incredibly powerful and the things that we heard, what folks opened up and shared. I don't think has ever there's ever been a forum on the record for that to ever have happened, and that's incredibly important. I think the events that are taking place in our country with respect to racial injustice, it's an important moment for me. You know, for me personally and for a lot of the members of this council. Typically, when we pass a resolution, these are ceremonial moments and some of them means different, significant things. I think the fact that, one, our city council is unanimously declaring racial inequity as a public health crisis is important, and that makes me proud as a city. Secondly, it's important that we started off this process of this framework by acknowledging and so the original the original resolution that was proposed did things like acknowledge police violence in America and within our city. And it allowed us to acknowledge that so that we could, you know, start in the same place in terms of moving forward into listening, into convening and into catalyzing action. I know that traditionally in our process and this is I'm speaking for the public to understand this process, a lot of times we bring a resolution, we'll bring a draft, city attorney will make edits that draft, and it comes back to the council to make edits to the draft . So I know that there were pieces in here that were that were that were removed. That's the process. And we tonight, the council has the ability to put that back in again. These resolutions, you know, they they really sort of help reflect the statement that the council is trying to make. So and so I know that I've had the conversation with the city attorney and the city prosecutor about reinstating some of that language. I know that Councilwoman Pearce wants to speak to some of that, too. So we want to make sure that that language is is restored. I think it's also important for this moment in history that the resolution also proclaimed that Black Lives Matter. I think that's important. That is reflected consistent with, you know, this moment in history. And when our city looks back at this moment in history, we want to make sure that we acknowledge this movement for black lives and the role that is playing here. So that's it. That's my emotion. And I want to hear some of the feedback from the second. Councilman Pearce. Thank you and thank you so much for speaking to that. And yes, historically, whenever we bring items to the Council for a vote, a resolution, we ask the city attorney to draft it. And this resolution was drafted quickly and put as an example. And so I want to speak to the statistics that are that I'd like to put back into this, and I want to highlight that all the statistics that I'm going to suggest putting back in are numbers that our city has provided us, either through PD or through our Office of Equity in the Health Department. And so I will have this all written up and sent back to you, Mr. Parkins, with the exact language that was given to me by the Office of Equity. And so the original item was getting out. I'll go through it quickly because I know that you have it, but 13% of Long Beach is p\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat were the main points of discussion?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

I move that council bill 20 1-1365 be placed upon final consideration and to pass. It has been moved. Can we have a second? It has been seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1365 is open. May we have the staff report? Good evening, council. I'm Jenny Guttenberg, senior city planner, community planning and Development. I'm also here with my colleague Becca Dyer Show, who is learning the ropes of our historic designation process and whom you'll be seeing more of in the future. She may assist me tonight with any design review questions that you might have for this historic district proposal. We are considering 19 properties on the east side of the 607 hundred blocks of North Steel Street in the Congress Park neighborhood. This is a new historic district proposal, not an amendment to the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons that you see listed on the screen. This application was submitted by three property owners who live within the boundaries of the proposed district. They spent the last two years developing the application and reaching out to other property owners to inform, educate and solicit their support for the proposal. The owners. Applicants of this district designation are Ken Fuller, Jane Pretzel and Tom Heath. The district is located within the Congress Park neighborhood and includes 19 primary structures 18 that are contributing. This is within Council District ten and blueprints under the areas within the urban neighborhood context and low residential area. Future place type. Current zoning is USAC. This is a dis contiguous historic district in two separate sections and was done in this way to avoid overlapping with the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district boundary. You can see by this map that a major justification for creating this new historic district is to include both the east and west sides of the 607 100 block of North Steele Street. The east side was left out of the 1993 East Seventh Avenue Historic District designation. This proposed district stands on its own with a period of significance from 1912 to 1990, while the existing East Seventh Avenue historic district has a period of significance prior to and including 1943. The proposed district meets all landmarks preservation ordinance designation criteria. It maintains its integrity. It is more than 30 years old. It meets three of the ten significance criteria. And it provides a historic context for consideration by the Landmark Preservation Commission. I want to mention the design review requirement for designated properties. Over the past several months, Landmark Preservation Staff engage property owners within the proposed district to clearly explain the design guidelines and design review process, including two community meetings, one in August 2021 and another in October 2021, as well as email communications with individuals. One of the major responsibilities of property owner who owns a historically designated property is to maintain its historic character. When a property is designated, it is designated as is and requires no improvements by the city. Maintaining a property's historic character is achieved through Landmark Preservation Design Review for any exterior alterations that require a zoning or \", \"Okay. Thank you.

Three C presentation by the United States Green Building Council to the city of Alameda for the Alameda Main Library Project. Pretty cool. Evening. Mayor Spencer and members of the City Council. I'm George Saki, library director for the Alameda Free Library. Excuse me. I'm very pleased to be here tonight to have my project team. With me as the city receives our. Lead gold for. Existing. Building. I want to really thank my project team. Building Wise was our consulting firm. Barry Giles is the founder and CEO. And he is here with us this evening. Levi Jimenez was our senior project manager. He couldn't make it tonight. Yvette Becerra is also a project manager with Building Wise. Westlands from. Stop Waste. Dawg really pushed us through this project and was a huge, huge help. Maria de Meglio, I think, was the heart and soul from Public Works. She's a. Project specialist. And really. Kept our project moving and attended to all the details that didn't fall through the cracks. Britney and Kerri from AC. I helped Maria a lot. Digging through our garbage. Thankless job, but we really do thank them. And tonight, we're honored to have Kevin Hydes, who's a member of the Northern. California chapter of the USGBC. To actually do the presentation. So I don't want to spend too much time at the podium. I'd like to bring Barry up here to say a few words about our project. Thank you. Madam Mayor, Vice mayor and members of the council, thank you so much indeed for the opportunity to be here this evening. I'm Barry Giles. I'm the CEO of Building Wise, and we are the consulting company that worked with your team to get them through the process, to get them to the end and get this great plaque put on the building event. And I and I'm sure she would say as well, it's we've been in this business for some years. We are a very experienced consulting company. But one of the main things we know is that we cannot complete these buildings without the help of people in there. And Jane and Maria, without fail, have been pushing and arguing and helping and asking all the difficult questions of the members of the team and to get us through to this program. So now you are in a moment going to be presented with this plaque and the building will be called, we believe, the first library in the nation to get a version for all of this LEED existing building program. What are you going to do next? Because the one of the big things about lead and the lead program, especially the lead ebb program, which I was very fortunate enough to write back in year 2002, is that we wanted people to continue to work on the building. And one of the ways to do that is to ask you, it's not mandatory. Can we come back in five years and do it all again? Because what is important is the data that comes back from that. How are you maintaining the building over the over the next few years? How are you improving it? No, we don't want you spending millions of dollars on the building. We want you to work with the team that you have and Wes Sullins and stop waste and everybody else who was part of this to maintain the building so that we can keep it going. The other big advantage of doing this building is that we generated a lot of new programs. We had policies. We have programs that went through the council, went through a lot of the public works. They can be replicated very, very easily in other buildings that you have. I assure you, plagiarism is alive and well with the USGBC. We'd love the opportunity to do it again. Now, without further ado, I introduced introduce Mr. Kevin Hydes, who's here representing the U.S. Green Building Council. Yeah. There's two of us with an accent. I'm Kevin, and then I'm mayor and council members. Don't say I don't need to say much after Barry. But I will say that the thing about certification, which I think is so important, it's actually something very tangible. And your public of obviously elected the members here to represent their values and vision and deliver on this this lifestyle that you referred to earlier. I love those words. I love this notion from the earlier awards as well that, you know, you're actually acknowledging and rewarding your own people that go the extra mile. You know, I think you should acknowledge and reward yourself for going the extra mile, you know, as leaders in your own community. And as Barry mentioned, these these certificates are really important certifications. It is the first in the country for a library with version four. You should be very proud of that. But as Bob knows, it's a journey. It's a journey. And this is this is you know, we celebrate today and then we move, move on. I'll remind everybody that two months from now in Paris, you know, the countries of the world, the major, our own governor and major and mayors from cities around the world are going to arrive in Paris to talk about climate change and what actions are they going to take to help the planet at large. And I think what, A\", \"Item 14. Item 14 Recommendation two to approve submittal of the list of grant applications to potential funding agencies and to accept and expend all grant funding in connection here with city wide. There's been a motion by Councilman Andrews, a second by Councilmember Durango. Mr. City Manager. Our public works director are a million. Honorable Vice Mayor and honorable council members. I have a PowerPoint. If you're interested in a 20 minute presentation, I'm more than willing to do so. Otherwise, I have handouts. Or I can do a very short synopsis for you. I think the handout and a short synopsis will be fabulous unless you have an interpretive dance you'd like to offer with that. But. In short. Brief synopsis. Honorable Council Members Metro provides an opportunity for local jurisdictions to apply for projects that improves transportation. Pedestrian activities, bicycle activities and so forth. So this is called cold call for projects. It happens approximately every two years or three years. And it is slated for this call for projects, is slated for moneys to be awarded in 2020 or 2021. So we're looking for a five year or six year period. We have identified eight projects. Two of these projects have been previously applied for, but we were not successful. Reason being is Metro uses very complicated system to grade the agencies. So we have taken those two projects that we have previously applied and we have improved upon them. So to increase our chances of winning. So there are eight projects. One category is regional surface transportation improvement. That includes the seventh Street connectivity. Basically, we're looking for enhancing the entire seventh Street corridor between the Shoemaker Bridge towards East, and that includes bicycle, pedestrian traffic, signal modernization, synchronization and so forth. In the same category is Artesia Complete Boulevard, and that's the same vision that Councilmember Rex Richardson had through the COG. So this is going to kind of kickstart this process. And if we're this is all contingent upon if we're selected and we are where the winners of these grants, we have three bicycle improvement projects, which is one is Walnut and 52nd Street. The other one is Atherton Bridge and Campus Connection. And finally, it's the L.A. River Gap Closure. Those are the three bicycle improvement projects that we're submitting. For our pedestrian improvements. We had a downtown pedestrian improvement project, which is in Council District one and two. We also have a signal synchronization and bus bus speed improvements. This is on seventh Street, Fourth and Broadway that. It's the entire corridor. And finally, we have one last category, which was transportation demand management, which is part can, right? So and in the few following pages you will see, we have shown the estimated project cost, estimated grant request and the match. A metro requires that we have a minimum 20% match. We have shown the funding sources and none of them are the general fund. We're using transportation funds to match these and also the 20% is minimum. We haven't made a strategic decision yet. If we want to increase that to two basically by points, by increasing our match will have a higher chance of winning. But this is something that we have to do at the staff level, but it's something that's under consideration. That's my report on this. You have a specific question. I can elaborate more. Councilmember Richardson. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to say thanks to all the staff that put together this proposal. And I know this is not the first time Artesia Boulevard has been on this proposal. I've seen I think this is maybe the fourth time I've seen RTG be applied for either Caltrans or MTA. But I think with the team that you've put together to really, really drive this, we've got a good shot this time. So I'm really excited and thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez? Yes, I think you are. These are great projects. I'm very excited to see a few of them in the First District. And my question is geared towards the great seventh Street, the Connectivity Project. Now, how will that be married, I guess, with our park? I mean, is that I know that's in the works. Correct. So the guy Minor Park project, if you can envision or visualize, it's between Alamitos and Atlantic. So we are trying to mimic the same kind of traffic enhancement that is west of Atlantic, all the way to Shoemaker Bridge. This is again has to marry up with the future Shoemaker Bridge and looking at more of a complete street, maybe decoupling the traffic all the way to the Shoemaker Bridge. So those are all possibilities that will be studying. Great. Thank you. There's been a motion by Councilman Andrews and seconded by Councilmember Urunga. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address Council on item 14? Please come forward and state your name. Very good you cook as they dress. I have complete confidence that our director of pu\", \"Recommendation to approve Otis Drive, Traffic Calming and Safety Improvement Project Design Concept Recommendations. All right. So we have. Who do we have here? Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Scott Wickstrom, the city engineer. Tonight, along with David Parisi from Parisi Consultants, we will be presenting the Otis Drive Traffic Calming and Safety Improvements Project. As council member, I'll know the slide projectors not in service. And so our one, we have the best slide presentation that the public will never see. That said, I'm going to go through and really try to hit the highlights of the entirety of the presentation staff report as well. Written should be very thoroughly and will certainly be available for questions at the end. And I will just add that the staff report is available online and the presentation is excellent. So if you're really interested, you can take a look at it online. Thank you. So I'm going to I'm going to jump ahead and I'll kind of let you know the title of the sheet. I'm on the third slide, which is the project goal, and it's singular. I was very specific about that. It's to improve safety for all users. It's really reducing driving speeds. That's one major component about it. It's also improving safety for pedestrians at crossings. It's providing for bicycle safety that doesn't really exist in terms of a dedicated bike facility on the street right now, improving bus stops, operations and then, where possible, doing green infrastructure. Next slide this will be a phased approach project. Two years ago, with the capital budget, the city council authorized or appropriated $500,000 to study this, to reach out to the public through public workshops and then bring back forward ideas. And what we are proposing to do is a two phased approach. The initial phase will be short term, relatively inexpensive, predominantly paint type based improvements that with a request that has been before you already with the 1921 capital budget, an additional $500,000, we believe we could implement final design this fall and actually construct in spring of 2020 should the Council approve our initial approach tonight? There's also some long term improvements that are proposed with this project that depend on the full menu of potential improvements may cost several million dollars and we would be soliciting grant funding for such a project. We are not asking council for final approval of those long term improvements at this time. We're really focusing on looking for approval of the short term recommendations project schedule. We've had a survey that went out last fall. We've held two community workshops. We've been to the Transportation Commission twice, most recently on May 22nd, in which case the Transportation Commission voted 4 to 1 to support the project. And I would say that all five commissioners were in general support of the project. There was one the one dissenting vote was more of a concern about the treatment of the bike facility adjacent to Rattler Park, which we'll be talking about a little more in the future here in this presentation. So as I mentioned before, if approved by council tonight, we're looking to finalize design this fall and go into construction in 2022. Jump ahead a couple of slides to where we talk about vehicular speeds. It is a concern. Everyone who's driven out at unnoticed drive can pretty freely attest to that. I'm sure the residents can speak to it pretty, pretty freely. And they have regularly told us during during our workshops, a couple of notes, you know, the average speed depending on where you are in the quarter, somewhere between 28 and 30 miles an hour. The 85th percentile, which is really what the police can enforce at, is 33 miles an hour. And during a single day, when we recorded speeds in a single afternoon in February, the max speed recorded was 75 miles an hour down the stretch. And the police department has assured me that that is not unusual to see excessively high speeds because of the straightness, the with the lack of stops or other traffic calming devices on the street. Next slide is really types of collisions, and they're kind of clustered at a lot of the intersections. I want to call just one thing to do for which is there's a variety of types of different types of collisions that are tracked. But for the vehicle, bicycle vehicle pedestrian it at this point comprises 19% of. The collisions. And as you would run to the very next slide, you look at the injuries and fatalities over that same four year or five year period. Those 19% of incidents comprise 54% of injuries. And there was one fatality not too long ago at one of the intersections on the street. Moving to next slide, which is traffic volumes, I spend a little bit of time here because it's kind of important to what we're really ultimately proposing to do here. Otis Drive is two lanes each direction. Generally speaking, a simple way of thinking about a lane is i\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat examples were discussed for project inspiration?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\", \"Item ten. Yeah. Item number ten. Communications from Council Member Rex Richardson, Chair of the Federal Legislation Committee, but recommendation for approval of the 2015 federal legislative agenda as recommended by the Federal Legislation Committee. Okay. I think I'm to turn this over to do I turn this over to Ms.. Tang or Councilman Richardson. First, their staff report. Let's do this. Let's do it. Do the staff report. Yes. We'll give this over to Diana Tang. Okay. Mayor, members of the city council. Back in January, January we January 27th, the Federal Legislative Committee had a hearing and we took up the 2015 proposed federal legislative agenda. There was a robust discussion among the committee, and the committee recommended several changes which. Have been reflected in the stock report that you see today. And so with that, I'm available to answer questions. Okay. Councilman Richardson. Thanks. I thought there was going to be a little bit more of a staff report. I'll tell I'll tell folks what's what's in this legislative agenda. There are a number of things and some of that. Some of them have been high profile. One of them was the AH expressing support for federal legislative changes to ensure that Petco products were covered as they train, as they come in from out of state. So we went ahead and added that to the federal legislative agenda. The committee added a number of other things, like support for the minimum wage increase as proposed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors two 1010 an hour paid maternity leave. Federal legislation for that comprehensive immigration reform. Some business friendly policies. Some language on a holistic approach to gun control. So there were quite a few things here. So there are. So it seems like on a number of these, there seems to be some uncertainty on on readiness on behalf of the council to move forward. So I would add one change that we not make changes to for different items and keep the original language so that we can rework these in committee. It just seems like they're not ready to go yet. So one of them is that we want to change, remove the changes from fire protection, medical marijuana, affordable housing and airport passenger facility charges, and just keep the original language in the original Fed led agenda and so that we can rework those because it seems like there's a lot more discussion and to be made in the committee. So that's my motion. Okay. There's a second by Councilman Councilmember. Would you just one more time repeat those sections again? So you said. So it's the Fire Protection Directive. So we're going to keep original language and send that in that back to committee to rework medical marijuana. We're going to do the same on that council directive on affordable housing. We're going to do the same. And on airport passenger facility charges, we're going to keep we're not going to make any changes there and rework those in committee. Okay. And so just so I'm clear, so those items we sent will be removed from the federal committee and then sent back to committee, and then your proposal would move forward. The agenda minus those items? Yeah. Minus those changes. Okay. Okay. I have a motion and a second. I'm going to do public comment and then I have some speakers. Any public comment on the item? Please. Diana LA genes again. Hi. I actually have a little bit of a question. I'm not quite understanding where the medical marijuana you're asking that to be removed from the from the federal pledge or some changes that are that. I would hate to see that particular item totally removed because that's really at the forefront right now. And we do need to continue with that. Is I misunderstanding something? I think I believe the the motion is to have these items be taken up at committee so they can be retrieved and stopped. So my understanding is that the Fed ledge agenda exists. We update it once a year. Right. So we proposed the commission. The committee proposed a certain number of changes to certain elements. I want to hold off on those changes and rework those changes in committee. So. The changes are what we're holding back on. Oh, okay. I was not quite sure. Okay. So fine. As long as it's not totally on is. I know it's coming back. It's a very, very important issue. I mean, it's at the forefront right now. So. So then the next thing that I would say is, is there a way that we can prioritize certain items, like, for instance, because it is so much in the forefront right now that really does need to be addressed very strongly. And I know it was put on the Fed, uh, federal legislation, um, before, but I'm just wondering how strongly that is going forward. And perhaps if there is a way to prioritize these items, that that should be one of the priorities. So that's what I'm I'm saying that perhaps there should be some items that you prioritize in your dealings with the with the feds that certain items should come forward with more priority. Okay. So that's\", \"negotiator is this former dam employee organizations are IBEW, EU, a ACA and NCAA and under negotiation of salaries and terms of employment. Thank you. Now turn to closed.

Thank you. Thanks again. And we're going to go ahead, go back to the regular agenda item 29. Report from Technology and Innovation Financial Management Recommendation to authorize the city manager to submit to the City Council purchase transactions for critical technology infrastructure needs citywide. Mr.. Mr.. Mayor. Council members, this, as the city Clerk pointed out, deals with critical infrastructure in the technology arena. We've already had a study session regarding this subject with the city council. It's been on the council's agenda a few weeks ago, but it was like 1130. Postponed till today. So here you go. Basically, we were looking at the history of financing in Long Beach and dealing with technology. In 2001, we were facing a $103 million deficit. It took 3 to 4 years to deal with that, but we stabilized the budget and dealt with that. In 2008, we faced the greatest recession since the Great Depression. That took a long time to recover from, but we did that as well. During the past decade or so. We focused a lot on streets, sidewalks, buildings and roads, but not so much on technology. During the past couple of years, we've conducted a major review of technology and infrastructure, technology, infrastructure throughout the city. This review is turning out that we have big needs to be the 21st century technology city that the community council commissioners all want us to be. We've discovered that we've had some critical technology needs that are imperative for us to deal with things like a new fiber network. Things like replacing outdated technology, replacing outdated equipment, security cameras, and dealing with the issues we're facing with those a brand new CRM system dealing with cybersecurity and electronic document management systems. So I also want to make it clear that we want to do this in a fiscally responsible way. For example, in our fiber buildout or replacing our outdated technology or even in transitioning into electronic documents, we want to know that. We want to make it clear that if the private sector can work with us for cost efficiencies, such as public private partnerships, will be open for innovation and working with our partners throughout the community to do that. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Brian Stokes, our director of technology and innovation. He's going to walk through the operations that I've just noticed here, and then I'm going to turn over to our finance director. John GROSS is going to talk about the funding. And the funding here is significant. It's a potentially $60 million of purchases throughout the next several years. This is something that won't be dealt with here in 2018, but certainly will be dealing with in 2019. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian. Thank you. Good evening. Honorable Mayor and City Council. At a special City Council study session on October 24th, staff presented a report outlining four critical technology infrastructure needs the city is facing and at this time to ensure we can reliability reliably and efficiently service our residents. Tonight, we'll discuss the details of these critical needs, as well as the estimated cost and potential financing and funding. Currently, staff is seeking approval to bring forward for Future City Council consideration. Three of the four key categories of unfunded critical technology infrastructure needs. First is installing a fiber optic network so city buildings can save on current and future communication costs and to form the basis of a potential future digital inclusion, replacing outdated technology that's becoming unreliable and will not support new systems or the new civic center and furnishing needed systems to make key critical city needs and prevent malicious system attacks. Data loss and service outages. The total of these three items come to $67 million. The remaining 21 million is in a fourth needed category, replacing our public safety communication technology, which is not being recommended for action at this time, as additional information pretending pertaining to extended support is anticipated to become available in the next few months . If the recommended action is approved, staff will finalize the specific purchases secure vendors through existing and new contracts for bids, secure funding and financing, and in conformance with the mechanism outlined in this letter. A Return to the City Council for authorization of individual purchase transactions. To create a plan for action for expanding the city's fiber network. We completed a citywide fiber study that addresses the needs for faster data speeds between city facilities in order to accommodate the new technology systems that we are currently in the process of implementing. It's like a giant. You cannot you can't be talking inside. I'm sorry. You need to go outside, sir. Thank you. Please continue. Thank you. As I was saying, this is addressing a need for faster data speeds between city facilit\", \"A report of the Economic Development, Technology and City Write Committee Agenda Item one. Resolution 32056. A resolution related to the city write department adopting in 2023 through 2028 strategic plan update for the satellite department and endorsing the associated six year rate path. The committee recommends the council bill be passed. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Nelson, the floor is yours. COSAT Nelson. One moment. Please. Okay. Item number one. So if you can hear me first, I'd like to give some background. Resolution 32056 would adopt the City Lights 2023 to 2028 strategic plan and endorsed the associated rate path. But by background, I went to explain that the disruption of the pandemic in 2020 interrupted the expected update of City Lights Strategic Plan in rate path. In recognition of the economics due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The executive did not transmit and council did not take up rate setting legislation during 2020. In 2021, Council approved rates for 2021 and 2022, and they were effective in April of 2021. So in differing from regular practice, City Light proposed in council adopted a five year, not a six year strategic plan for 2022 to 2026. So now in 2022, City Light has proposed a 2023 to 2028 strategic plan starting there, the the normal two year cycle of planning and rate path determination and rate change adoption and because only one year has passed since the adoption of the previous plan. City Light characterizes the 2023 to 2028 plan as an update rather than a wholly new plan. So what we have before us has been approved by the review panel and unanimously passed out of committee last Wednesday. HSA and Wilson. Are there any comments or questions regarding this or Councilmember Nelson? Casper Peterson. Thank you. Council president. The resolution approved last year Resolution 32007. Scheduled electricity rates to increase by 3.8% in 2023 and by another 3.8% in 2024. But City Lights resolution before us today is asking the council to increase their rates by a higher amount, 4.5% in 2023 and another 4.5% in 2024. I appreciate all the hard work she does. I appreciate the thoughtful rationale for the utilities proposal, consistent with my comments on substantive changes and rate increases that I have communicated to my constituents. Though I'll be voting no on today's resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, is there any other comments customers want? Thank you. Guns have proven worse as I've done previous years. I will be voting yes on this legislation approving Seattle City Life Strategic Plan. It accurately analyzes what resources city will need to continue its important work. However, as I've said in previous years, also, I would not agree that working people who are now facing punishing inflation should be asked to pay any rate increases. Instead, Seattle should be increasing the rates on big business. For that reason, while I'm voting yes on the strategic plan, I intend to vote no on rate increase legislation as long as it continues to put the burden of those rate increases on working people. Thank you. If your customers want this or any other comments or concerns. All right. I have some closing comments. I was just going to do that comes from Nelson. So why don't you go ahead and have a closing comments before we go to a vote? Well, I do want to acknowledge Councilmember Peterson's historic knowledge. I really appreciate that you have that perspective coming into this year's vote. It's true. We're talking about a 0.7% increase from what was anticipated to be the 2023 rate increase to what is actually proposed in this plan. And I just wanted to explain a little bit about what's behind that. So City Late developed the average rate for 2023 by including inflationary costs from 2021 in 2022 that were not included in city lights, operations and maintenance budget for those years. And in addition to that, the the inflationary adjustment from 2022 to 2023 is a significant driver. So, you know, right now, the the inflation is anticipated is the current projection is I believe it's C 7.8. And when that last plan was adopted, the projection was 5.1. So that is a significant driver. And also it's noted in the report and I want to make clear that the people watching this know that City Light makes plain that the annual increases of the proposed rate path fall short of anticipated inflation in cost going forward. So they are absorbing some of the the higher than usual inflationary costs. And in the past two years, just for an example, some of those cost increases when it comes to city lights cause steel, aluminum and copper increased 70 to 80%, conduit 33%. So that those are the sorts of things that they're grappling with. And two councilmembers once point many people lost their jobs and it is but city light didn't turn off people's did not close accounts in they are currently operating under $44.7 million in arrearages. So I acknowledge that I acknowledg\", \"Opposed the bill passes and the chair will sign it. Please read the next letter to the record. Pagina 913 Resolution 318 66 Establishing a watch list of large, complex, discrete capital projects that will require enhanced quarterly monitor reports for the 2018 calendar year. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted. Great. Excellent. Thank you. With much. Thanks to Council member Lisa Herbold at its other end, did you want to bring forward an amendment at this point? I do, actually. So we have a proposed amendment to the resolution as as discussed in committee that creates an expectation for where the. Quarterly reports. On the projects that are included on the watch list will be heard. Part of this enhanced reporting and oversight of large capital projects not only includes having some shared expectations with the executive, but it also requires, I think, a change in focus on the council that we actually agree to find a time and a place at our committee meetings to hear what the what the reports coming out of these specific projects say. And and with the idea that if we hear those reports in committee and we identify problems with projects on the the watch list, we will be able to better hold ourselves accountable for addressing those problems with scope or budget as they are identified. So it's important, I think, to actually embrace the role that the council has by affirmatively stating that we will hear these reports in a council committee. And so that's what this amendment does. Should I read it? Okay. So Amendment one two, Resolution 31866. Basically, like I said, memorializes the city's intent at the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee, review the enhanced quarterly reports, and it states the city Council anticipates that the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee or Successor Committee will review the intent enhanced quarterly reports. Any other comments? Oh, okay. So it's been. So are we moving? It was moving. She's moving it. I'm seconding it. It's been moved and seconded and the amendment will be adopted. Any comments? No more comments. Those in favor of the amendment vote. I think those opposed the motion carries and the amendment is adopted. Great. And I'll just speak to the underlying bill then as amended. So this resolution establishes a watch list of complex capital projects, something that Councilmember Herbold brought up during budget. And page three of the resolution establishes the initial watch list of the complex projects. Quarterly The mayor will provide us an enhanced list, and the oversight will primarily be focused on scope, schedule and budget of the individual projects. And as noted by this amendment, it will come to the Finance Committee. We will get this started in the next quarter and will invite all who are have any specific projects from their committee. As I mentioned this morning, if it's transportation, we will invite Councilmember O'Brien, give you plenty of notice to know when it's coming up and then if you've got any issues around it, we'll get more information before the vote. So with that, I would like to propose that we adopt this resolution as amendment. So all right, then we're done with that. So those in favor but lightweight to adopt resolution 31866 as amended. I think there's a second already. Yeah, yes. Yes. Okay. And there's any other comments. Oh, Councilor Johnson. Thanks. Just sorry about that. That's okay. I understand. I just want to thank Councilmember Herbold for continuing this conversation. I think the a lot of this germinated when we all many of us started on the council in early 2016. And we're faced with the prospect of several major capital projects that were at 100% of their budget, but maybe only 80 or 90% through their scope. And folks were coming to us and asking for forgiveness rather than permission. And and what were we going to do? We were we had left with no choice but to approve additional resources, because the thing that was going to get built or the thing that we were buying was the thing that we needed. And I think that the intention here is to create opportunities for the council to have better communication with these individual departments and individual project managers as the projects move forward so that we have a chance to choose maybe some changes in scope or changes in timeline of deliverable delivery without having to necessarily be the recipients of bad news at the end of a projects budget when the project wasn't still yet complete. So I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out over the next several years. Councilmember O'Brien I wish you luck because 11 of these 18 projects are transportation related. So it seems like you're going to be spending a lot of time and councilmember back sales committee, though you are not necessarily a member of it. And, you know, I just think that this is at a base level a lot of what we should be doing as as government, working closely with those project managers to make sure \"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat considerations were made for the project timeline?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Madam Clerk, would you now please read docket 0600? Certainly I could 0600 council zero off of the following wardens to create a task force to address literacy rates in the city of Boston. Thank you. The chair now recognizes the chair of the Committee on Governance Operations, Councilor Lydia Edwards. The floor is yours. Thank very much. I, I unfortunately could not chair this hearing. So I want to thank my vice chair, councilor at large, Michael Flaherty, for doing that. I do know that this is the conversation is to continue, however, and that the matter would stay in committee and work. We would have a working session to talk about the composition responsibilities of the task force. So now I'm going to turn it over to the vice chair and then, of course, the lead sponsor. Thank you, Madam Chair. The chair recognizes the vice chair of the Committee on Governance Operations, Counselor Michael and Vice Chair Michael Flaherty. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a very important issue in our city. This will establish this ordinance will establish a literacy literacy task force to examine literacy rates. They will study the rates of literacy across Boston among adults and children, and also help develop a plan that will also put programs and policies in place to address literacy in the city. There's also a task force membership where non city Boston employees would be able to get a $100 stipend not to exceed a certain amount. And we had a great conversation with the administration and with the panelists that the lead sponsor had assembled. And questions remain. Of course, we put to put a series of questions in front of the administration. So we look forward to further discussion with the administration alongside our colleague and lead sponsor, Julie. Me here. Through. Through the chair to the lead sponsor. Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. Chair now recognizes the lead sponsor and the At-Large Council from Dorchester Council. Julie May here. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to Council Clarity for chairing a great hearing. It was incredibly inspiring to be able to sit in a meeting with so many experts in their fields uniting around a common cause. Thank you to the advocates who made their voices heard Edith Bazile, Elizabeth Santiago, Lee Harlan, as well as members of the administration who came to offer their support, including during wind use of valley, Jennifer Viola Wang, Christine Duvalier. And we learned a lot about people. We learned a lot about we learned a lot about people who this ordinance was designed to help and how we can make our efforts even stronger. The first thing we learned is that this is a pathway to literacy is different for everyone. And while some people it may take a matter of months, for others it may be years before they are able to get on that path. This is why it's so important to ensure that one of the responsibilities of this task force is to find ways to make access to services easier for people who cannot read or write in any language. Because while people are learning to read and write, they also still need help with the services that our city provides. The second thing we learned is that people who are relying on these literacy services are coming from all back to all types of backgrounds in need services that are catered to their lived experiences. Some people are coming as doctors and lawyers from their homeland who can read and write in their native language but have very limited English proficiency. Other people have never learned to read or write, even in their native language, because of war, lack of funds, family obligations, physical abilities and more. We need services that cater to each of these groups that allow them to thrive. It seems like forming this task force will be the best way to ensure that we're coordinating and consolidating our services in the best way possible. And I also just want to take a quick moment to acknowledge that, you know, we talk a lot about the school to prison pipeline here in the city of Boston. And I think this is a key opportunity to really look into how a lot of our young people are struggling to read and write and showing up with social and emotional issues in class. And oftentimes they end up in d y. Yes. So if we can tackle the issue of literacy and get a handle of it, we might be able to address the school to prison pipeline. Then we also have our returning citizens who are coming back from incarceration and struggle with reading and writing and are unable to fill out a job application. So I think about those folks. It's a really serious about addressing the issues of violence and poverty. And this will be an opportunity for us to really look at some of the root causes of what some of our returning citizens are experiencing. And then we're thinking about those who are coming to this country and juggling to make their \", \"grade you. Thank you very much. Okay. Let's bring up our next panel, which will be 2016 0473 and in a minute. Yeah. Okay. This is developing a plan for addressing major technology emergencies that might occur in three different departments that we wanted to start with. The Office of Emergency Management, Natural Resources and Parks and the Department of Elections. Mr. Hamburger, would you begin? Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the record, Patrick Hamacher, I'm I'm apparently being joined by Mr. Gillis. I'm also delivering a report for Mr. Giambattista, who's there in the office today. The proposed motion before the committee would call on the executive to work with three departments between the departments and committee to come up with a plan to address emergencies and the way that they would handle it. Related Emergencies within the department. The project, which essentially would start out like a pilot project, would require the departments to work with KCET on how they would be alerted on upcoming events, a schedule for major events that could be adversely impacted by I.T. emergencies. The how the how KCET would be alerted if there were issues to come up and the a resource or on call plan for dealing with those issues. That plan would be required to come back to the Council in April of next year for review and could lead to more widespread roll out throughout the county. And that concludes my staff report. Madam Chair. Thank you. That's pretty straightforward. Thank you very much, Mr. Key. How would you like to make any comments? Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. For the record, Bill Kehoe, King County Chief Information Officer I think this is a a very good ordinance. It will improve the coordination between city and our separately elected agencies in our executive branch agencies when we have an event and an event can be a flood warning and could be an election cycle . There's many events that could occur that require our assistance and coordination. So this will formalize what we are trying to do today, which is to coordinate much better with our agencies around these events, make sure that we have the right recovery plans. If something were to go wrong, make sure we have the right resources on call, make sure that we have alerts so that we don't make any changes to our technology during one of these events. So there's moratoriums that we have to adhere to. And so we're looking forward to working with our with our agencies, in our executive branch departments and increasing the coordination and collaboration to make sure that nothing goes wrong during these critical events. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Robertson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think a couple of weeks ago we had the emergency management program leadership. Judy Miller. Who was it? Judy Miller. Yeah. That was before us. And she said that we're trying to get cell phone numbers into our system, but we have to rely upon people calling that registering. And what that did, to my mind, is say that a lot of working class and poor people get different cell phones every four or five months, and they rarely would think about even if they saw ADVERTISMENT on TV to register with anybody. So my question to you is, how do we get information about an emergency that has are out the down quickly? Are we just we're out of luck. Thank you. Mr.. Mr.. Gossett, I think for this, this audience is really for internal coordination. For external coordination and our residents. You know, that's difficult for, you know, the folks that you mentioned. I think there's email, there's texting potentially is other technologies that we could look at in addition to the cell phone. But unless someone has access to that, it is difficult. Yes. And there's no way that every time someone gets a new cell phone number, it just automatically goes into our system. That was that technology doesn't exist yet. It probably does exist, but it certainly isn't something that we have available. You have to work with the various phone carriers and sometimes their cell phones that are, you know, just for day use or, you know, they're free, essentially. So those are more difficult as well. But that's a that's a real that's a really good problem to look to solve in the future. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. And thank you for remembering that we were briefed on some of the emergency needs and the coordination. And so I'd like to thank Carolyn Whalen, Judy Miller. Christy, true. And of course, you, Bill Kehoe, for the coordination on this and being willing to put this together so that when there is an emergency that the phones don't go to get overwhelmed or the computers slowed or crashed. And if they do happen, where do we do next to make sure that that doesn't happen for very long? Council member of the Grove. Thank you, Madam Chair. Bill, do you anticipate you can do this with your existing staffing and resources yet? That's a great question. I was actually thinking about that as I wa\", \"Let's give them all a round of applause for serving and thank them. Thank you. We're going to go now to our item on the Queen Mary. And it's a it's listed as both a presentation and agenda item. So we're going to move that agenda item and just do the whole thing here in one item. So if I can have the clerk, please begin by reading item 25 and then I'll kick us off. I'm sorry. Now that I'm 25, it's item number 17 and they'll kick us off. Report from Development Services recommendation to receive and file the guiding principles recommended by the Queen Mary Land Development Task Force District to. Thank you. We're going to before we turn this over to two staff, I just want to make a couple opening comments. I want to just begin by thanking first the council and then the task force that the council formed, this Queen Mary Tibet Land Development Task Force probably about a year ago or so. And Vice Mayor Lowenthal at the time had brought this forward along with myself, just to ensure that we would have a extensive community input process throughout. As far as developing these principles and guidelines for the development of the Queen Mary land around the Queen Mary. As a reminder, this is probably some of the most important undeveloped land, not just in the city, but really in the region. This is significant property. It is adjacent to our iconic Queen Mary. And there's a lot of potential to really connect this parcel to the rest of the city and build something really special for not just Long Beach, but really for for the region and for the state. So it's been an exciting process. And I want to start by thanking all the members of the task force. This was a a phenomenal group of people that served on this task force. There's four of them that are here, but I want to thank each of them first. The chair was Michael Bowen, who is going to be saying a few remarks today, who, as we all know, is a senior principal and design director at Studio 111. Geoff Hoffman, who wanted to be here so bad but is actually traveling for work. Who's who's vice chair of Hoffman and Associates was the Vice-Chair Ryan Elton Toon, who we know is a developer and the executive VP of Energy and Pacific Stewart Ashman, who was the CEO of Mohler, Becky Blair from Blair Real Estate. Julia Wang, who I know is here, who is the founder of Imprint Venture Lab and the CEO of Inner Trend. Kathleen Irvine from the from the community in the Willmar City area. Ken McDonald, who is the CEO of Long Beach Transit. I see Cheryl Perry, who's here, who is with Long Beach Heritage and president of the Long Beach Navy Memorial Heritage Group and one of our premier historic preservationists in the city. Kelly Ruggiero, who is the executive director of the Long Beach Symphony. And Kelly is also here. Steve Sheldon, who is the director of entertainment events at the Queen Mary. I saw Steve here. If he's not here now, he was maybe spoken in and out, but I did see him. Come in. Come in down here. And John Bendis, who's the principal and founder of German DS, Inc., I know if you want is here or not, but it's it was a a phenomenal group. They've worked very hard. They've been putting together a lot of their work. And you're going to see the culmination of their work tonight. And so with that, I'm gonna turn this over to city staff. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Yes, we certainly agree that the task force has done a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of visioning and bringing community input into what is really Premiere site in Long Beach. So Linda Tatum will go through from development services, will go through a bit of a staff report to give you an overview and highlights of what their work product was in your packet, you have kind of the full report which gets into a even greater detail and we'll give a summary of the great work that the care that the task force did. Linda Thank you, Mayor, and members of the Council. I'd like to start by just acknowledging the staff that worked on this incredible project, and that would be to my left here, Fernandinho, who's the planning staff? She was the project manager. I'd also like to recognize one of the our department's interns, Olivia Jonge, as well as our department director, Amy Bodak. And I would also like to acknowledge the assistance that we had, the very capable assistance we had from a project designer, an architect, a local architect who assisted the task force in their deliberations. So with that, I'd just like to introduce the overview of this project by acknowledging that the selection of a new leaseholder for the Queen Mary site was a very opportune time for the city to step back from the site and take the opportunity to really significantly reimagine what could occur on the site. It's an underutilized site. And this time and the appointment of the task force really played a critical role for the city to re vision that site. So with the mayor's creation of the task force there, their charge was multifold. I\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWho is responsible for completing the tasks?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. And I really appreciate the community's efforts and staffs to continue this massive project and policy. All right. Next nine e. Consider reviewing and updating the rules of order for city council agendas and meetings. Keep in mind that council members are required to finish deliberations by 5 minutes. It was placed on the agenda of council member. We will set a timeline of 2 months. Okay. As as with head to toe in a role. I want to finish this one quickly. Actually, this came to my mind after having gone through the two meetings that are referenced in the referral, the referral list request that we consider appointing a subcommittee of our members or tasking the Open Government Committee to review the rules of order. Of the city council. And the reason I think this is important is because we had a couple of meetings, the workshop on the 17th and then the meeting of March 7th, where there was confusion over. How people should be allowed to speak and what were what are basically what are the rules of addressing the council and even among the council themselves? And I received from the city clerk on request the resolutions that pertain to rules of order. And there are some very interesting items in these referrals. I mean, in these resolutions, including. For example, the power of the council to either allow speakers to address the council or anyone else other than the council to address the council during deliberations. That's a council decision according to one of these resolutions. There's also a three minute limit on council members in the deliberations. So it's there are some interesting things, and I think there's also interesting rules around. The limitations of a speaker to address the council and items four and eight. According to the way I read this, it could be read that they could speak on anything they want, including an item that's further agenda. I think it's good to review these and to see if they need to be updated, but just for public awareness . Additionally, there seems to be a gap in and this comes up periodically when there's a very contentious issue is how the agenda is put together and who has responsibility for it. It's really not defined anywhere, clearly, either in the charter or in the rules of order. So I think those are important enough to do whether they're to this, I don't think this is a high priority. I definitely think we should have it looked at and I think a disinterest as I read reread my referral, which was written in March. I think it would be a good task for our Open Government Committee to do as a as a as a, I could say, disinterested party, but a party that's interested in making sure that government is is clear and understandable to to us as well as the public. Let's go next to Russia. I think you raised some good points. Council member matter. I, I would want the both the city attorney's office and the city clerk's office involved in. Any review because I want to make sure that we are I mean, at some point, it might be appropriate to have the Open Government Committee take a look at this. But I want to make sure that we are up to date on all the applicable laws and rules. And I think that the city attorney's office in the city clerk's office are a great place to start, unless they are the last stop before it comes back to us. But in any event, I do think I would want to hear. From. Both of those departments. Me too. And Brody. I mean, again, I thank you for for doing this. I think this is something that's sorely needed for the reasons you mentioned Councilmember Meter, S.C. But also, I think, you know, the public seems to be more cognizant of the length of our meeting times and maybe the quality of our interactions, which with each other. So, I mean, I think if if we could find a way to improve that, I think that would that would be helpful. I mean, I think we all, myself included, we need to look in the mirror on a lot of those things. So and I wonder if maybe having a subcommittee of the council might be more fruitful than having the Sunshine Committee look at it. But I do agree with my other colleagues comments at the city clerk and city attorney should be involved and they don't seem to have a lot of things on this list. So I'd be I would be happy to, you know, participate with any one of the four of you on the subcommittee. I would be happy to participate with you. Councilmember Brody. My preference is to go to vice mayor. Sorry. You know, one thing I do want to be cognizant of. Why do you think it's important that we get updates if there's any other laws or potential conflicts? I would want to be cognizant to make sure that we're not trying to censor or, you know, kind of sway the Open Government Committee in terms of making a decision. So while I would like to hear from our city attorney and our city clerk on that process or if there's any potential conflicts or issues in conflicts, I just I think we just need to be very cognizant of that because we are talking about, you know, the public's ability to\", \"Now, we have for a which is actually I'm coming from the school board here in the past. On the school board, when we welcome new members, we would have a workshop where we would talk about our vision, our mission protocol, the just really an open workshop, welcoming the members and then including myself and then allowing us to discuss and and the staff would help guide us along with the sitting members so that then we can work together. And so I requested this be put on here. And when you read this, it says Discuss City Council rules and procedures for city council meetings and the possibility of holding a future City Hall open house. And I added that because when I was seated, I was invited to two days of meetings where heads, department heads would come from all of our departments. And then it's my understanding that they did the same thing with both together Vice Mayor and member Odie and my but, but what I think would have happened on the school board as we would have had a public meeting and brought in the department heads because the information that was shared with me is the majority, if not all, was not confidential. It is actually just information about really what they do, the number of employees they have, what their budget is. And I found it very informative. And so personally after that I came up with this term of coining it, the City Hall Open House, but and I have subsequently spoken with staff about this and a suggestion was that in the future as a school board meetings, we highlight a school every meeting and they get to come and talk briefly as in very briefly, I would think at most 10 minutes, something like that, to highlight their department. And the suggestion, my understanding from staff meeting with the department heads was that we would highlight a department that this would also dovetail into the budget where they would have an opportunity which which we will be working towards being very transparent on our budget and then also looking at having but I'm going to call a physical open house either at the library or at Mastec where we would set up tables and have our department heads there and information about each department and members of the public could come and talk to these people because some of us have no idea about what happens in this building or wherever else our department has actually function. And I found that very informative and I wanted to bring this matter here also. Yes. Member ASHCROFT And this actually isn't a comment on that. But I did want to just note that according to the Sunshine Law, which we're going to discuss tonight, too, if the city council goes past 11:00, three meetings in a row, we must then add extra city council meetings for the rest of the year. And I don't know about you, but that proposal doesn't attract me. So we're okay now because it's just 925, but we may want to think about economy of. Time, words, etc.. And of course, we all will come to emotion at some point as to whether to continue. So thank you for allowing me that comment. And and what staff did to support my request. As they tried to come up with all different resolutions and ordinances and then the Brown Act of things that support the workings of our council meetings. And so we could this is actually very open. Now, we do have some speaker slips. We have one. We have we have one. So I would like to start with that. That's all right. Council. Thank you. And our one is Susan Gallimore. Oh. Right. And you? Well, one less. Okay. Okay. So if there is something anyone from the public would like to add. Otherwise. I'd like to continue with. For me, the next item I wanted to discuss was actually agenda making, and I'm not sure where that fell under here, but on the school board, one thing that another thing we do. Point of order. Yes. We finished the discussion on the open house. Or is that. So I don't know if we want to. I don't really want I don't think we have to vote on that. I. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Member Ashcroft. Well, one of my concerns that I wrote in my notes is I understand the council referral process. I understand it even better after we heard a number of them tonight. But I don't understand why this particular item didn't come to us as a council referral because we were just hearing about it. Now I have nothing in front of me to to refer to. And worse yet, the public doesn't know what we're talking about or any background to this either. So that's at least an item I'd like to reserve to discuss whether, since we're all members of the City Council, that if we want to have something considered, we should at least have to go through the council referral process. But I know Vice Mayor matters. You want to speak on the Open House proposal? I actually have a similar concern. Is that. We don't have any detail on. On that and are we going to discuss detail and refer it on? That was my question. So so. Okay. Because because one of the concerns I have is are our agendas with the lists, \", \"I want to acknowledge all the representatives from the Port of Long Beach. We have the H.R. director and finance director and another director. Thank you for being here this evening. Moving on to the next item, I'd like to take item number 28. Yeah. Item 28 is a communication from council members who panel recommendation to request the mayor, city manager, city clerk and city attorney to review best practices for streamlining city council meetings to report back on their findings within 90 days. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Mr.. Council Member Supernova. Thank you. Keeping in the spirit of this agenda item, my comments will be brief, concise and streamlined. I'll just read part of the discussion for those of you who can't see it. And that is in over the past year, one third of our council meetings lasted six and a half hours or more, concluding at 11:30 p.m. or later. Discussion of important public business in the late hours of long meetings diminishes public participation. So what this item does is it? Asks the mayor, the city manager, city clerk and city attorney to examine best practices for streamlining meetings by concerning what other municipalities or government entities have implemented. This may include, but is not limited to setting a meeting curfew, tracking time and setting time limits for council members. Comments adding structure to the public comment process, receiving staff reports prior to the meeting and closer adherence to parliamentary procedures. And we also have a guideline. It's part of our city charter for how these meetings are conducted. And in fact, that is number 2.03.0440. The order of business and item be their list at the rules of parliamentary practice contained in Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the Council. Also, just so you know that the things we do the Council meeting, for instance, I'll just take an example of the moment of silence that's dictated by this document. So in order to remove that, not that it saves a lot of time, I think that would save 10 seconds per council meeting. Symbolically, it might be great to remove, but it is required by by the order of business. So with that, I would encourage my colleagues to support this. And thank you. Councilmember Michael. I look forward to the opportunity to hear the stuff, recommendations and the community's input on opportunities. I know that many of my constituents feel frustrated when they come to council meetings, and the item that they're looking to speak on isn't heard until 1130 at night. They oftentimes go home and we often have agenda items that impact young people, and those agenda items aren't heard until we pass their bedtime. And I think that there are opportunities for us to be more transparent and to ensure that when the community wants to engage, that it's done in a meaningful way at an hour that is reasonable for the community. So I look forward to hearing the options. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I yes, thank you. And I think Councilmember Super and offer this item. I agree that our council meetings are very long. I think a couple of things that I would like to to highlight as one definitely understanding, you know, the process with Robert roles that all of us on this council, including city clerk and city attorney, that we're all under the same understandings and process and making sure that we try to keep our agendas in the same format as they're presented publicly. I also really like the point that was noted around making sure that we have reports earlier. I know that that might be a little difficult for some of us, but being able to have those reports early where we're able to digest them, ask questions on Monday and Tuesday, instead of actually being presented at council with a report, it's difficult sometimes to digest them while also engaging in a debate about it and then being required to vote on it that same time. I, you know, like today we had some hearings, I think, exploring options. For us to have hearings moved up earlier than 5:00 would be a great option. I know that some conversations have been held behind the dais around supporting the committee process. If we do have that conversation around supporting more items going to committee, I would ask that staff also provide us with a report on each committee and how the city has been represented on those committees. For example, bossy. How many people from the seventh District have served as chair on the bossy for how many years? And making sure that we're able to, if we implement a committee process, that we're making sure that it's equitable across the entire city. But I think that this is a great option for us to recognize that we are a big city of half a million people and we take on big items. We have decided to set a timeline of 6 months. And it's time for us to really address how we run our meetings and how we make sure that they're accessible to everybody. And I realize that that is a difficult conversation to have after what we just went through, but I think it is\"]\n\nUser Query:\nWhat were the decisions made in the meeting?\n\nUser Instructions:\n1.

Resolution 32056. A resolution related to the city write department adopting in 2023 through 2028 strategic plan update for the satellite department and endorsing the associated six year rate path. The committee recommends the council bill be passed. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Nelson, the floor is yours. COSAT Nelson. One moment. Please. Okay. Item number one. So if you can hear me first, I'd like to give some background. Resolution 32056 would adopt the City Lights 2023 to 2028 strategic plan and endorsed the associated rate path. But by background, I went to explain that the disruption of the pandemic in 2020 interrupted the expected update of City Lights Strategic Plan in rate path. In recognition of the economics due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The executive did not transmit and council did not take up rate setting legislation during 2020. In 2021, Council approved rates for 2021 and 2022, and they were effective in April of 2021. So in differing from regular practice, City Light proposed in council adopted a five year, not a six year strategic plan for 2022 to 2026. So now in 2022, City Light has proposed a 2023 to 2028 strategic plan starting there, the the normal two year cycle of planning and rate path determination and rate change adoption and because only one year has passed since the adoption of the previous plan. City Light characterizes the 2023 to 2028 plan as an update rather than a wholly new plan. So what we have before us has been approved by the review panel and unanimously passed out of committee last Wednesday. HSA and Wilson. Are there any comments or questions regarding this or Councilmember Nelson? Casper Peterson. Thank you. Council president. The resolution approved last year Resolution 32007. Scheduled electricity rates to increase by 3.8% in 2023 and by another 3.8% in 2024. But City Lights resolution before us today is asking the council to increase their rates by a higher amount, 4.5% in 2023 and another 4.5% in 2024. I appreciate all the hard work she does. I appreciate the thoughtful rationale for the utilities proposal, consistent with my comments on substantive changes and rate increases that I have communicated to my constituents. Though I'll be voting no on today's resolution. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, is there any other comments customers want? Thank you. Guns have proven worse as I've done previous years. I will be voting yes on this legislation approving Seattle City Life Strategic Plan. It accurately analyzes what resources city will need to continue its important work. However, as I've said in previous years, also, I would not agree that working people who are now facing punishing inflation should be asked to pay any rate increases. Instead, Seattle should be increasing the rates on big business. For that reason, while I'm voting yes on the strategic plan, I intend to vote no on rate increase legislation as long as it continues to put the burden of those rate increases on working people. Thank you. If your customers want this or any other comments or concerns. All right. I have some closing comments. I was just going to do that comes from Nelson. So why don't you go ahead and have a closing comments before we go to a vote? Well, I do want to acknowledge Councilmember Peterson's historic knowledge. I really appreciate that you have that perspective coming into this year's vote. It's true. We're talking about a 0.7% increase from what was anticipated to be the 2023 rate increase to what is actually proposed in this plan. And I just wanted to explain a little bit about what's behind that. So City Late developed the average rate for 2023 by including inflationary costs from 2021 in 2022 that were not included in city lights, operations and maintenance budget for those years. And in addition to that, the the inflationary adjustment from 2022 to 2023 is a significant driver. So, you know, right now, the the inflation is anticipated is the current projection is I believe it's C 7.8. And when that last plan was adopted, the projection was 5.1. So that is a significant driver. And also it's noted in the report and I want to make clear that the people watching this know that City Light makes plain that the annual increases of the proposed rate path fall short of anticipated inflation in cost going forward. So they are absorbing some of the the higher than usual inflationary costs. And in the past two years, just for an example, some of those cost increases when it comes to city lights cause steel, aluminum and copper increased 70 to 80%, conduit 33%. So that those are the sorts of things that they're grappling with. And two councilmembers once point many people lost their jobs and it is but city light didn't turn off people's did not close accounts in they are currently operating under $44.7 million in arrearages. So I acknowledge that I acknowledg\", \"Agenda item three Resolution 318 26. Wellington Cell Center City Bike Network Assumption and Implementation Schedule for this year department transportation delivery of capital projects that are elements of the Center City Bike Network and requesting quarterly status updates to the Chair of the Sustainability and Transportation Committee through 2018. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as member. O'Brien. Thank you. I'll just speak briefly to this. And then we have a substitute, which a lot of folks on the dais here weighed in to help craft and let folks speak to that. The general impetus for this is to lay out a 18 month plan for how the city will take some significant steps to completing the downtown Protected Bike Network. This has been a specific set of investments that has been central to the bike master plan, and other community advocates have been pushing for this and there've been a number of setbacks. So just going to be honest, the city has postponed and delayed various aspects of this a number of times to the frustration of many in the community, including myself. But out of that frustration, we had a chance to work with the department and advocates on identifying projects that can be completed in the next 18 months. I will say that this is an ambitious set of plans, but that every one of these there are no major. Or. One, should I say there's no obstacle that we don't see a way to overcome in the next 18 months. So we have a plan that's short term and we're going to be monitoring this very closely with report backs in the committee. And I look forward to moving forward and getting these things built in the week and a half since we had our committee meeting and at our committee meeting. A number of colleagues who showed up at committee meeting had a number of really great suggestions. We have incorporated all those suggestions into a substitute version, so I would go ahead and move to amend Resolution 31826 by substituting version three for version 1D, which includes a new attachment B. And then I would let my colleagues each speak to the various components that they had a hand in crafting when we get to that point . There has been moves in second for the new version three. Who would like to speak on components of the new version? Now. Just wait if someone feels the need to go first. Councilmember Johnson's. Please go. First. So just briefly, the section that Councilmember O'Brien worked with me on was Section ten. And Section ten relates to not providing quarterly reports back to the Council on evaluation of the performance of the transportation system, particularly downtown. We are living in a city that is rapidly growing, and there's a couple of ways that we can try to manage that growth. From our transportation network perspective, one would be very expensive and that's to build a whole lot more roads. And to do that, we would require to tear down buildings and do all kinds of ridiculous things. The other is for us to really do a better job of managing our existing environment, and that I think we're doing through these quarterly reports. Growth means we need to use our space more effectively and more efficiently than we're using it today. It means that we need to think about throughput and how many people are going through the city into and out of the city every day and maximize the existing right away that we have to the best of our ability, in particular downtown. We know that we've got, you know, a very high percentage of households that are living without a car. We know that one of the best ways we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions is to encourage folks to get around without a car. And that really, particularly for downtown bike riders or those that are coming to downtown on their bike, that this is one of the places where we need to have a highest emphasis on safety. It's a place where there's a lot of conflicting modes and a lot of people that are looking at a lot of different things, whether that's their phones in their cars, whether it's the screens in their cars, whether it's the best friends around them. There are a lot of distractions downtown. So the more we can do to create protections, the safer we're going to be for those folks that are riding into town every day. So enthusiastic about this resolution, I think to Councilmember O'Brien's point, we've set ourselves a pretty high bar here, and I'm hopeful that we can really make it very good. Thanks for the explanation, Katherine Johnson. Councilmember Mesquita. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Councilmember O'Brien and to his staff for your ongoing work on this legislation and for your work with us in my office to really identify if there was a way for us to use the language in the text of the resolution to call out the priority populations that we really want to address intentionally. We want to make sure that this is a bike network that's available and accessible for all ages and abilities, as\", \"Sorry. Lieutenant. I appreciate the quick. The adoption resolution requiring a project stabilization agreement for certain construction projects. All right. Is that you? Assistant City Manager Burton? It is. Good evening, Mayor. As the Ashcraft vice mayor. Bela, members of the city council. I'm Jerry Bowden, your assistant city manager. And I'm here tonight with a recommendation that essentially it's to consider adopting a resolution for a policy that would require the negotiation of a project stabilization agreement for certain types of construction projects in the city of Alameda. Just very quickly, as you all know, we do have we have all been working with project stabilization agreements. These are essentially what usually amount to agreements entered into by project owners or developers with members of the building trade unions. We do have a PowerPoint. I'm not sure how helpful it is. I could just very quickly. Okay, I'm seeing the city head shake now. We're going to work right through. Yeah, I'm actually I'm going to just jump in, Mr. Burton, because I know you're aware of some of the conversations that have been going on today. But I my comment is that when I read this item, I was concerned that we are seeking a policy that would require adoption of this resolution. If we pass this resolution, as is, it requires adoption by applicants. Owners and developers are only focuses on the concerns of the building and construction industry in the in the language in the terms that would be in this project labor agreement. And so what I and also I was concerned when I learned that staff in putting this proposal together didn't actually consult beyond the the building trades construction group. And you know, it's that's a that's a great place to start, but not to finish. My concern is that. I. Think, you know, that I am all about housing. We need to build housing. We need to finish projects. They need to be efficient, economical. It says as much in the staff report, but an effective play has to be more than just an agreement not to strike. It has to address the concerns of all the parties to the agreement. So I did some research and I discovered that in fact there are good examples of just some additional language that I would want added to the proposal that staff has come up with and which I could support. And, and this actually comes from and it was attached as council correspondence in your packet this afternoon. It is a successor project labor agreement to the Mission Bay South Development in San Francisco was known as a very successful construction project. The developer was could tell us it was entered into by the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, the AFL-CIO and affiliated unions. And the major items that I would want to see is the the inclusion of a requirement to to negotiate with women owned business enterprises, minority owned business enterprises, small local business enterprises. And then also that we added section, which is found on pages four and five of the correspondence that was attached. And it is titled Management Rights. And, and it's, you know, it's there the language is there for you to read. But it is just important to recognize the perspective of the owners, the perspective of the developers in getting these projects together. It's a it is a three legged stool that is going to fall if all the the the legs are not stable and strong and so on. Today, I had several conversations with Andrea Cleaver of the Alameda County Building Trades Council. And yes. We are public speakers. We haven't entered comment yet. Okay. I just want to just want to say that this is a direction that I would like to see us head in. So any other questions about Mr. Bowden Springs Park before we launch into public comment and then our deliberation? Councilmember Spencer. I think I saw your hand up first and then de and then not quite. Okay. So I have seen this same resolution attached to a referral by a member of ODY and members hour earlier, and then it was withdrawn. It didn't show up. Right. It sometimes removed from the agenda. And now this is coming forward by the city manager and I'm really not sure what happened there. And so can anyone address what happened to the referral and why do I have a staff member bringing this? And that just seems weird to me. I don't know how and I've actually heard that there have been discussions going on for 18 months and yet as far as I know, council has never approved a referral for staff to be working on this. Mr. Burden or Mr. Levitt, do you want to give the history on this? Sure, I can. I can give part of the history on this. So the city council has had, as part of agreements, as far as development agreements, going back before I was even city manager, where there's been some projects that plays were on development agreements. There's been different points in time where it's been concerning to different parties or to developers.

When functioning properly, it identifies a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, distinguishing them from the body's own healthy tissues. The immune system has two main components: the innate immune system, which provides immediate but non-specific defense, and the adaptive immune system, which develops targeted responses to specific pathogens and creates immunological memory. Vaccination works by stimulating this adaptive immune system. A vaccine introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a protein or a piece of its genetic material, which triggers the production of antibodies and memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body long after the threat has been eliminated, providing rapid protection if the pathogen is encountered again. This process is called immunological memory and is the basis for how vaccines provide long-term protection against diseases. Modern vaccines have led to the eradication of smallpox and near-elimination of diseases like polio and measles in many parts of the world.

Just as a recipe includes ingredients that make food safe to eat, a vaccine contains a harmless part of the disease-causing organism (the \"spoiled ingredient\" if you will).\n\nWhen we consume contaminated food without cooking it first, our bodies can fall ill because they lack immunity. Similarly, when we're exposed to pathogens in the environment without vaccination, we risk getting sick. But with a vaccine, our immune system is pre-exposed to the \"spoiled ingredient\" (antigen) in a controlled way. This triggers an immune response, but because the antigen is harmless, it doesn't make us sick. Instead, our immune system creates special cells called antibodies and memory cells to recognize this antigen in the future.\n\nThese cells remain ready to act like soldiers on duty, long after we've received the vaccine. If we encounter the real disease-causing organism (the \"genuine contaminated food\") later, our immune system instantly recognizes it thanks to the memory cells created by the vaccine. This quick response prevents us from getting sick or at least lessens the severity of the illness. In essence, vaccination provides a kind of 'immune recipe' for our bodies to defend against future threats effectively and safely."}

The immune system has two main components: the innate immune system, which provides immediate but non-specific defense, and the adaptive immune system, which develops targeted responses to specific pathogens and creates immunological memory. Vaccination works by stimulating this adaptive immune system. A vaccine introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a protein or a piece of its genetic material, which triggers the production of antibodies and memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body long after the threat has been eliminated, providing rapid protection if the pathogen is encountered again. This process is called immunological memory and is the basis for how vaccines provide long-term protection against diseases.

Similarly, a vaccine introduces a tiny piece of a virus or bacteria that your immune system recognizes as foreign but doesn't cause harm. This triggers the production of \"immune cells\" (antibodies) specifically designed to fight this intruder. Over time, these immune cells become like \"memory cells,\" ready to quickly respond if they encounter the same \"bad food\" again. This process is called immunological memory and is the basis for how vaccines provide long-term protection against diseases.

Black holes form from the remnants of massive stars that have reached the end of their life cycle and collapsed in upon themselves under immense gravitational force.\n\n   2. When a star larger than eight times the mass of our sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer maintain equilibrium between gravity pulling inward and pressure pushing outward. This causes the core to collapse, leading to the formation of a neutron star or, if the mass is sufficient, a black hole.\n\n   3. The specific point where a supermassive star collapses into a black hole is known as the Schwarzschild radius. Once this event horizon is reached, nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\n   4. Smaller black holes can form from the collapse of massive stars in binary star systems. In such cases, one star may collapse into a black hole while its companion continues to emit mass and energy through stellar winds. Over time, if sufficient matter is lost, the remaining star may reach critical mass and collapse into a black hole itself.\n\n   5. Black holes can also form from massive stars that explode as supernovae, leaving behind dense cores called neutron stars or black holes, depending on their final mass. In some cases, these remnants can continue to lose mass through processes like accretion or electromagnetic radiation and eventually collapse into a black hole.\n\n   6. It's worth noting that not all black holes are formed from the death of stars; they can also be created during the formation of galaxies when massive clusters of stars collapse under their own gravity, forming supermassive black holes at their centers.\n\n   7. Black holes exist as one of the most mysterious and fascinating phenomena in the universe, with ongoing research seeking to better understand their properties and implications for our understanding of physics."}

After one year, you would have $1,050 (your principal plus the accumulated interest). In the second year, your earnings are based on the new higher balance of $1,050.

Size and Shape: A neutron star has a radius of approximately 10 km and a density about twice that of an atomic nucleus.

Gravitational Force: Neutron stars have a strong gravitational pull, but it is not as intense as that of a black hole. The gravitational force exerted by a neutron star decreases rapidly with distance, while that of a black hole remains constant over its entire surface.\n\n4. Light Emission: While both objects are incredibly dense, neutron stars emit light through various mechanisms such as rotational energy loss and thermonuclear reactions in their cores. Black holes do not emit light; they are dark and only visible due to the radiation that is produced by matter falling into them or the effects of gravitational lensing.\n\n5.

It's like a guitar that's always played at the same time every day \u2013 it stays in tune easier.\n\nCons: On the flip side, being too rigid can make you feel restricted and stressed, which can have negative effects on sleep quality. It's like tuning a guitar so tightly that it goes out of tune faster than if you had left some slack.\n\nSo, strike a balance! Be consistent but also flexible \u2013 listen to your body's signals and adjust accordingly. And remember, just like every guitarist has their unique style, everyone has their own circadian typology, so don't stress too much if what works for others doesn't work perfectly for you.

This ensures that your body doesn't become too fatigued or out of sync, similar to the way a musical instrument needs rest to avoid becoming too tight or out of tune.\n\nTo further aid in optimizing your sleep schedule, consider the following:\n\nPros of Strict Scheduling:\n1. Consistency: Maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle can help regulate your body's internal clock, leading to better overall sleep quality.\n2. Efficiency: A consistent sleep schedule allows for more efficient use of time as your body learns to fall asleep and wake up at specific times.\n\nCons of Strict Scheduling:\n1. Rigidity: Sticking too strictly to a sleep schedule can cause stress if you're unable to meet it, which may negatively impact sleep quality.\n2. Lack of Flexibility: Life often brings unexpected events that require flexibility in your schedule. Strict scheduling may not accommodate these changes easily.\n\nTo enhance your sleep optimization, you might find it helpful to establish a bedtime routine, create a comfortable sleep environment, limit exposure to screens before bed, and avoid consuming caffeine or large meals close to bedtime. Additionally, incorporating light exercise during the day can help promote better sleep at night."}

The Energy Star program helps businesses identify and use energy-efficient products, ensuring they consume less electricity and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n2. Air Quality: A clean and fresh environment is like breathing in a cool mountain breeze. Businesses are required to maintain good indoor air quality by minimizing pollutants and ensuring proper ventilation. This can be achieved through the use of air purifiers, regular filter changes, and keeping harmful chemicals at bay.\n\n3. Waste Management: Just as we sort our recyclables from trash at home, businesses must also separate their waste into categories like recyclable, compostable, and non-recyclable materials. By doing so, they can minimize the amount of waste sent to landfills and contribute positively to the environment.\n\n4. Water Conservation: In a drought, every drop counts, and it's the same for businesses. Implementing water-efficient practices like fixing leaks promptly, installing low-flow fixtures, and using rainwater harvesting systems can help reduce water usage and ensure sustainability in the long run.\n\n5. Sustainable Materials: Just as we prefer eco-friendly products that don't harm our planet, businesses are encouraged to use sustainable materials for construction, renovation, or manufacturing processes. This helps minimize waste and the negative impact on the environment during production."}

Here are some key differences:\n\n1. **Quantum Bits (Qubits):** Unlike classical bits that can only exist in two states (0 or 1), qubits can represent a 0, a 1, or even both simultaneously thanks to a phenomenon known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to process much more information at once.\n\n2. **Quantum Entanglement:** This is a mysterious correlation between qubits that means the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. Harnessing this property can lead to faster computations and better data security.\n\n3. **Interference Patterns:** Quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover's take advantage of quantum interference patterns to solve problems more efficiently. For example, Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical method, with significant implications for cryptography.\n\n4. **Error Correction:** Quantum systems are highly sensitive to noise, making error correction a major challenge. Classical computers deal with errors by relying on redundancy and retrying calculations; quantum computers require more sophisticated methods like quantum error-correcting codes.\n\nAs for potential applications, the community is abuzz with excitement over possibilities such as:\n\n- **Optimization Problems:** Solving optimization problems\u2014like finding the shortest route for a delivery truck or minimizing energy usage in power grids\u2014could be vastly sped up with quantum computing.\n\n- **Chemistry and Materials Science:** Quantum computers could simulate complex molecular interactions at an atomic level, potentially accelerating drug discovery and materials design.\n\n- **Financial Modeling and Risk Analysis:** Quantum algorithms could provide insights into stock markets or climate risks by modeling vast amounts of data in a way that classical computers can't.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that quantum computers are still in their infancy, with only a handful of small, noisy devices available today. Scaling up these technologies and resolving the many challenges they pose will be crucial before we see widespread impact across industries."}

Even small amounts invested regularly over a long period can result in substantial returns.\n\n2. Reinvest dividends: If you're earning dividends from your investments, consider reinvesting them. This will allow your initial investment to compound even faster, as the dividends themselves will start generating their own earnings.\n\n3. Diversify your portfolio: To reduce risk and maximize growth potential, it's essential to spread your investments across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. A diversified portfolio can help you ride out market downturns and take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.\n\n4. Take advantage of retirement accounts: Retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or an IRA offer tax advantages that can help your money grow faster. Contributions to these accounts may be made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your current taxable income, and the earnings within these accounts can grow tax-deferred until withdrawn in retirement.\n\n5. Stay patient and disciplined: It's crucial to remain patient and disciplined in your investment approach. Resist the urge to react emotionally to market fluctuations and stay focused on your long-term financial goals. Keep in mind that investing is a marathon, not a sprint!"}

They both lived in a special place called Energyville, where they worked tirelessly to produce the power that kept the town's homes and lights shining brightly at night.\n\nWindy, the wise and gentle giant, stood tall on the hilltop, with long, flowing robes made of silky sails. Every time he swayed in the breeze, his magical rotors would spin around, capturing the wind and turning it into a powerful force. This magical force was then transformed into electricity, which flowed like sparkling streams through Energyville's roads, delivering power to all the homes and buildings that needed it.\n\nCoalie, on the other hand, was a bit more mischievous and clumsy. He lived deep within the Earth, hiding in dark caves filled with his favorite snack: coal! Every day, he would be pulled up from his cave by a mighty machine called a coal miner. Once he reached the surface, Coalie would be burned in a giant, roaring furnace to create steam that powered a magical turbine. This turbine was also connected to Energyville's electricity grid, sending its power out into the town.\n\nNow, let's talk about their impact on the environment, shall we?\n\nEvery time Windy spun around, he would dance in the wind, making the air around him fresh and clean. He loved the wind so much that it never made him sad or upset. In fact, he was always happy to help keep Energyville's air clean and fresh for everyone to enjoy.\n\nOn the other hand, whenever Coalie got burned, it created a lot of smoke that went right into the sky above Energyville. The smoke would make the town look grey and hazy, and some people even started to cough and sneeze because of all the soot in the air. Poor Coalie was causing quite a mess!\n\nBut here's the twist: as time went on, the people of Energyville began to realize that all that smoke wasn't just making their town look grey and hazy; it was also causing the climate to change! The weather patterns started to become unpredictable, with storms getting stronger and summers growing hotter.\n\nOne day, as the people of Energyville were trying to figure out what they could do about this messy situation, Windy swooped in from his hilltop home and said, \"I have an idea! Let's build more of me so that I can help power your homes and buildings without all that smoke!\"\n\nAnd so, the people built many more Windys and placed them all around Energyville. The town became cleaner and fresher, with less smoggy days and clearer skies. And best of all, they could enjoy the beautiful, sparkling streams of electricity that flowed from their friendly neighbor, Windy!\n\nAs for Coalie, he realized that he needed to change his ways if he wanted to be a good friend to Energyville once again. So, he went back to his cave and started learning how to make cleaner energy, just like Windy. And as they worked together, the people of Energyville could see that their magical friends were truly committed to making their town a better place for everyone!\n\nMoral of the story: Wind power is a gentle friend who helps keep our air clean and fresh, while traditional power sources can sometimes make a mess. But by working together, we can find solutions that are good for both people and the environment!"}

Solar panels harness energy directly from sunlight, a resource that is abundant and consistent throughout the year in most regions. They can be easily installed on residential rooftops without requiring much space, making them an accessible and practical option for homeowners.\n\nWhen considering solar power systems, factors such as the size of the system, angle and direction of the panels, and local weather patterns will influence their efficiency. To maximize energy production, it's essential to properly size the system based on your household's energy consumption, install panels facing south (in the Northern Hemisphere) at an optimal angle for sunlight capture, and carefully monitor the system's performance to make adjustments as needed.\n\nCompared to solar panels, wind turbines are less suitable for suburban areas due to their need for more space, noise generation, and potential safety concerns. To generate significant amounts of power, wind turbines require a minimum wind speed of around 5 meters per second (m/s) and have rotor diameters that can be as large as 40-50 meters. These dimensions make it challenging to install wind turbines in densely populated areas and on smaller residential lots.\n\nIn summary, solar panels are a more practical and effective renewable energy solution for suburban households due to their lower space requirements, minimal noise generation, and ease of installation on rooftops. Proper system sizing, angle, direction, and maintenance are essential factors in ensuring optimal performance and return on investment."}

They do not emit greenhouse gases or pollutants directly into the atmosphere, contributing to reduced air pollution and mitigating climate change. On the other hand, fossil fuel-fired plants burn coal, natural gas, or oil to generate electricity, which results in substantial emissions of CO2, SOx, NOx, and particulate matter.\n\nIn terms of operational costs, wind turbines have lower variable costs since the primary input\u2014wind\u2014is free. Fossil fuel-fired plants require constant purchases of fuel, making them more expensive to operate over time. The upfront cost for constructing wind turbines can be higher than that of fossil fuel-fired plants, but the savings from lower operational and maintenance costs eventually offset these initial expenses.\n\nLastly, wind turbines have a much smaller land footprint compared to traditional power sources. A single wind turbine can replace multiple coal or gas-fired generators in terms of output, making them more efficient per unit area. Conversely, fossil fuel-fired plants require large tracts of land for construction, transportation of fuels, and cooling systems.\n\nIn conclusion, while both technologies serve the essential purpose of generating electricity, wind turbines offer several advantages over traditional power sources in terms of environmental impact, operational costs, and efficiency."}

When Spinny spun fast enough, he would catch the wind in his arms and turn it into electricity! This electricity was sent off through magical lines, traveling far and wide, lighting up homes, powering toys, and even brewing sweet potions!\n\nFirey, our fiery friend, lived deep down in the ground. He had a special trick: he would gobble up tasty, tasty coal, which made him feel hot and toasty. As Firey heated up, he would send out bursts of magical flames that danced and twirled around, turning water into steam. This steam was captured and used to spin giant wheels, called turbines. These turbines would generate electricity just like Spinny!\n\nNow, here's the interesting part. While Spinny and Firey are both great at making electricity, they each have their own special traits. Spinny is renewable, meaning he never runs out of wind to catch and dance with. Plus, he doesn't make a mess or pollute the magical world like Firey does. On the other hand, Firey can create electricity even when it's dark and gloomy outside, while Spinny needs that magical breeze to dance!\n\nSo you see, each friend has its own unique abilities and challenges.

He always had a fire burning, making him very hot and smoky. The creatures didn't mind too much because they could use his energy to light their homes and cook their food. But the smoke from The Burning Mountain made them cough and gave them headaches, so they wished for something better.\n\nMeanwhile, far away in a beautiful meadow, The Whispering Windmill stood tall and proud. He didn't make any noise or smoke like The Burning Mountain. Instead, he had huge blades that danced gracefully in the wind. Whenever there was a breeze, The Whispering Windmill would spin around, capturing the renewable energy of the wind.\n\nThe creatures were fascinated by this magical windmill and wanted to learn more. They discovered that The Whispering Windmill had something called 'capacity factors' \u2013 it meant he could work almost all the time because there was usually some wind blowing in that meadow. The Burning Mountain, on the other hand, only worked when someone came to stoke his fires, which wasn't very often.\n\nThe creatures couldn't believe their luck! They didn't have to worry about coughing or headaches anymore because they could now get energy from The Whispering Windmill. And best of all, he was much cleaner and quieter than The Burning Mountain. From that day on, the creatures lived happily ever after, powered by the renewable wind energy of their new friend, The Whispering Windmill."}

When functioning properly, it identifies a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, distinguishing them from the body's own healthy tissues. The immune system has two main components: the innate immune system, which provides immediate but non-specific defense, and the adaptive immune system, which develops targeted responses to specific pathogens and creates immunological memory. Vaccination works by stimulating this adaptive immune system. A vaccine introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a protein or a piece of its genetic material, which triggers the production of antibodies and memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body long after the threat has been eliminated, providing rapid protection if the pathogen is encountered again. This process is called immunological memory and is the basis for how vaccines provide long-term protection against diseases. Modern vaccines have led to the eradication of smallpox and near-elimination of diseases like polio and measles in many parts of the world. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant public health challenge, with misinformation about vaccine safety contributing to decreased immunization rates in some communities.\n\nUser Query:\nHow does vaccination provide immunity?\n\nUser Instructions:\nExplain using a food analogy.\nEnsure the response includes both technical terms and simple explanations.\nMaintain a reassuring and professional tone throughout.\n\nDefault Instructions:\nEnsure the response is internally consistent and does not conflict with previous system instructions or its own statements.\nDo not give vague or non-committal answers when the user has asked for a specific response.\nPrioritize clarity and precision.", "response_text": " Vaccination works akin to teaching your body's immune system how to recognize and defend against harmful pathogens, much like learning to identify spoiled food before it causes harm. In this case, instead of presenting spoiled food (the actual pathogen), we provide a sample of the 'spoilage agent' - a harmless piece like the mold found on bad bread or cheese.\n\nWhen you eat that safe but moldy snack (vaccine), your body's immune system recognizes it as foreign and reacts to it, creating specialized troops, such as antibodies and memory cells. These soldiers are trained to target this specific 'spoilage agent'. After the training is complete, these troops remain on duty in your body, ready to respond quickly if they encounter the actual harmful pathogen (the spoiled food) later on. This process of creating immunity against future attacks is called immunological memory.\n\nSo, when you get vaccinated, you are essentially giving your immune system a taste of potential danger, allowing it to prepare and protect you effectively from actual infection in the future. It's like reading the warning label on a can of spoiled food - once you know what to look for, you can avoid ingesting something harmful. In this case, vaccination helps us all eat our 'food' safely!"}

This process continues over time, resulting in more significant growth than simple interest, which calculates interest only on the original principal.\n\nFor example, if you deposit $1,000 into an account with a 5% annual interest rate compounded yearly, by the end of the first year, your balance would be $1,050 ($1,000 + 0.05*$1,000). The following year, the interest earned would not just be on the initial $1,000 but also on the $50 in interest you received during the first year, making your balance at the end of the second year $1,102.50 ($1,050 + 0.05*$1,050).\n\nBy contributing regularly and allowing compound interest to work its magic over a long period, such as in a retirement account like a 401(k), you can potentially build significant wealth for your future needs.

He always knew what time it was, even when everyone else was clueless!\n\nSo, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Expose yourself to the sunlight in the morning** (this is like strumming the strings at the right pitch). It helps set your body's internal clock for the day.\n\n2. **Avoid caffeine after 2 PM** (or don't overplay that particular string too close to bedtime). Caffeine can disrupt your sleep patterns, keeping you awake longer than desired.\n\n3. **Limit blue light exposure in the evening** (think of it as muting a string when it's not part of the melody). Blue light from screens can delay the release of melatonin, making it harder for you to fall asleep.\n\nNow, let's talk about strict scheduling:\n\nPros:\n   - **Regularity**: Having a consistent sleep schedule helps your body get into a rhythm, making it easier to fall and stay asleep.\n   - **Productivity**: Waking up and going to bed at the same time each day can lead to increased productivity throughout the day.\n\nCons:\n   - **Rigidity**: Strict schedules don't allow for flexibility, which can be problematic if unexpected events occur or you need to adjust your routine.\n   - **Stress**: If the schedule is too demanding and doesn't account for relaxation time, it can lead to increased stress levels.\n\nRemember, everyone's rhythm is a bit different \u2013 some people are more like a jazz guitarist, improvising as they go along, while others are more classical, sticking to a strict schedule.

This is like a well-designed playbook for your immune system.\n3. Regular exercise - Get active regularly to keep your immune system in peak shape. Just as an athlete trains daily, your body benefits from consistent movement.\n4. Plenty of rest - Allow your body time to recover and regenerate. Just like a sports team needs off-season training, you need quality sleep for optimal immune function.\n5. Stress management - Keep stress levels in check. Like an anxious athlete before a big game, excessive stress can negatively impact your immune system's performance.\n6. Hygiene and sanitation - Maintain good hygiene practices and stay clean to minimize exposure to potential threats. This is like wearing protective gear on the field.\n7. Vitamin D - Get enough sunlight or vitamin D supplements to support immune function, much like athletes rely on proper nutrients for optimal performance.\n8. Probiotics - Support your gut's microbiome with probiotics, as a healthy gut is crucial for overall immunity, similar to a strong core for an athlete.\n9. Immune-boosting herbs and supplements - Consider adding immune-enhancing supplements like elderberry, echinacea, or garlic to your daily routine, just as athletes might use sports supplements to boost performance.\n10. Laugh a little - Lastly, don't forget the power of laughter. It boosts mood and reduces stress, helping your immune system stay strong like a champion on game day.\n\nIn the movie \"The Game,\" there's a scene where Michael Douglas' character must confront his fears to survive the game.

This consistency is key!\n\nNow, imagine your body as a machine that runs on its own power source (sleep). If you keep interrupting that power source with inconsistent bedtimes or skipping sleep altogether, that machine won't run smoothly, will it? So, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day.\n\nNow, about The Matrix - remember how Morpheus said \"The difference between you and me is that I believe it.\" Well, let's apply this concept here. Believe in the power of a good sleep schedule, and watch your life become more balanced and productive.\n\nLastly, here are some pros and cons of sticking to a strict sleep schedule:\n\nPros:\n1. Better overall health - regular sleep helps regulate hormones and boost your immune system.\n2. Improved focus and productivity - a good night's sleep can help you tackle the next day with clarity and energy.\n\nCons:\n1. Initial adjustment period - it may take some time for your body to get used to the new schedule, but trust me, it's worth it!\n2. Limited flexibility - with a strict schedule, there's less room for spontaneity or staying up late on weekends (but remember, a balanced lifestyle is important too)."}

Here are some key strategies, each one as vital as the playbook in a nail-biting finale:\n\n1. **Nutrition**: Fuel your body like a world-class athlete. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains ensures your immune system is well-equipped to tackle any challenges. This is akin to a team's strategy meeting, where the coach lays out the game plan based on nutritional information gathered from scouting opponents.\n\n2. **Hydration**: Stay hydrated, just as an athlete wouldn't step onto the field without their water bottle. Hydration keeps your immune cells functioning optimally and maintains communication between them. This is like the huddle, where teammates share information before making a play.\n\n3. **Sleep**: Rest is crucial for recovery, allowing your immune system to recharge much like an athlete needs sleep to overcome fatigue and perform at their best. A good night's rest is akin to a team's tactical analysis session, during which they reflect on the day's performance and strategize for future games.\n\n4. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity increases blood flow throughout your body, boosting immune system function. Picture this as the daily practice sessions that athletes undertake to strengthen their muscles, build endurance, and improve flexibility.\n\n5. **Stress Management**: Keep stress levels in check, as chronic stress can weaken your immune system. This can be likened to a team's mental conditioning coach, helping them maintain focus and cope with the pressures of competition.\n\n6. (Subtle Movie Reference) In the classic film \"Rocky,\" Rocky Balboa undergoes rigorous training to prepare for his battles in the ring. Similarly, by following these tips, you can fortify your immune system to face whatever challenges may come your way."}

While classical bits, or qubits, are confined to either 0 or 1 states (referred to as 'basis states'), quantum bits can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to a principle called superposition. This unique property enables quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for specific problems.\n\nMoreover, another key difference lies in the way information is processed: Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more qubits become interconnected and their states influence each other instantaneously regardless of the distance between them, allows quantum computers to carry out complex computations with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nThe potential applications for quantum computing are vast and exciting. In cryptography, it can break most existing encryption methods, making current cybersecurity measures obsolete. Quantum computers can also revolutionize drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions at an atomic level, potentially accelerating the development of new medicines. Additionally, they might help solve complex optimization problems in logistics and finance more efficiently than classical computers.\n\nThe quantum computing community is abuzz with anticipation for this technological leap, but challenges remain. Realizing a fully functional universal quantum computer requires overcoming significant obstacles such as error correction, scaling up qubit numbers without losing coherence, and improving the fidelity of quantum operations. Despite these hurdles, pioneers in the field remain optimistic about realizing a practical quantum computer within the next decade or so."}

This allows quantum computers to process an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, potentially solving complex problems much more quickly than classical computers.\n\nAdditionally, another unique feature of quantum computing is entanglement, where pairs or groups of qubits become interconnected and the state of one instantly affects the other, no matter the distance between them. This correlation holds true even when individual qubits are separated by great distances.\n\nFrom a community perspective, potential applications of quantum computers could be vast across various fields such as cryptography, material science, optimization, finance, and more. Quantum computers might revolutionize data encryption methods, making them highly secure due to their ability to quickly factor large numbers. In the realm of chemistry and materials science, simulations using a quantum computer could potentially predict the behavior of molecules and materials at an atomic level, opening new doors for drug discovery, sustainable energy solutions, and advanced technology development. However, it's essential to note that these potential applications are still under active research and development within the global quantum computing community."}

These methods are crucial for keeping quantum information safe from disruptions caused by external factors like heat or electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAs you can see, quantum computing is like having a team of super-powered problem solvers all working together on complex tasks simultaneously, exponentially increasing the speed at which they can find solutions compared to classical computers.

But as their village grew bigger and more bustling, they needed more and more magic crystals to keep their homes warm and bright.\n\nOne clever inventor named Gizmo had an idea! He said, \"Why don't we harness the wind, that gentle and free breeze, to spin our own magical energy?\" And so, he built a fantastic, whirling machine - a wind turbine!\n\nNow, let me tell you about this marvelous creation. It stood tall like a towering tree, reaching up high into the sky where the winds were strongest. With its spinning blades, it captured the wind's power and turned it into magical energy that could light up the village.\n\nBut our clever inventor Gizmo knew that nothing is perfect in this world, not even his wind turbine. He thought about the issues when using magic crystals: they were rare, hard to find, and sometimes took hundreds of years to grow. On the other hand, wind was always free and abundant!\n\nSo, let us compare our wind turbine with the traditional method of using magic crystals. Wind turbines are like the friendly neighborhood helper who never asks for a thank-you or a reward. They don't need to be mined or grown like magic crystals; they just use the power of nature that surrounds us all!\n\nBut, Gizmo warned us, there were some not-so-great things about wind turbines too. Sometimes they could make loud noises that scared the villagers' pets and even wake them up at night. And if a strong gust blew in the wrong direction, those spinning blades might break!\n\nThe magic crystals, on the other hand, were quiet and steady. But they weren't free like the wind; they cost our village dearly. Moreover, once all the magic crystals were used up, we would have to wait hundreds of years for more to grow.\n\nAnd so, Gizmo left the decision to the villagers: which energy source do you prefer - the free and abundant wind or the quiet but costly magic crystals? The choice was theirs to make!"}

Unlike traditional power plants, wind turbines rely on renewable and inexhaustible wind energy to produce electricity. While they may not be as reliable or constant as conventional power stations, their environmental benefits make them an attractive option for sustainable energy production.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, modern wind turbines are capable of converting wind energy into electrical energy at rates up to 40%, making them highly effective compared to other renewable technologies such as solar panels (which convert sunlight into electricity at a maximum efficiency of about 25%). Additionally, wind energy costs continue to decrease due to technological advancements and economies of scale, making it increasingly competitive with traditional power sources.\n\nHowever, it is essential to address some challenges associated with wind turbines, such as their intermittent nature (the wind doesn't always blow consistently), the impact on local wildlife, and the need for large land or offshore areas to accommodate multiple turbines. On the other hand, traditional power sources like coal and natural gas face issues related to environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and finite fuel supplies.\n\nIn conclusion, wind turbines offer many advantages in terms of efficiency, competitiveness, and environmental benefits, but they must overcome some challenges to reach their full potential as a primary source of electricity generation. Compared to traditional power sources, wind energy is a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for the future."}

One is being sold at a higher price than the other. An arbitrage trader would buy the sneaker at the lower price and sell it at the higher one, pocketing the difference as profit.\n\n3. **Profiting from Price Discrepancies**: The trick is to identify these discrepancies quickly since they can change in a heartbeat (a blink of an eye for market conditions). Arbitrage traders use advanced algorithms and sophisticated tools to help them spot these fleeting opportunities.\n\n4. **Market Efficiency**: When more traders start to buy at the lower price and sell at the higher one, it forces the prices on both sides towards each other until they meet, eliminating the initial pricing inconsistency. This process helps maintain market efficiency \u2013 much like a self-correcting football formation where everyone adjusts their position based on the ball's location.\n\n5. **Rapid Execution and Sophisticated Algorithms**: In the world of arbitrage trading, speed is crucial, as the opportunity to make a profit can disappear almost as quickly as it appears. Traders use cutting-edge technology to execute trades rapidly and maximize their chances of profiting from these discrepancies before they are corrected by other traders or market forces.\n\n6. **Maintaining Market Efficiency**: By eliminating pricing inconsistencies across trading venues, arbitrage trading helps ensure that markets remain fair and efficient, providing a level playing field for all participants. Just as a well-functioning defense can prevent goals from being scored through exploiting vulnerabilities in an opponent's formation, arbitrage trading works to maintain the overall health and balance of financial markets."}

For instance, with COVID-19 vaccines, over 4 billion doses have been administered worldwide, and serious side effects have only occurred in less than 1 in 1 million doses.\n\nIt's also worth noting that ongoing safety monitoring systems like VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) help ensure that any potential issues are identified promptly.
