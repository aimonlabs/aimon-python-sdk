1,1,Mistral 7B,"Allergies happen when the immune system reacts to a foreign substance that gets inside the body. Allergies also can happen due to certain foods and medicines that don't cause reactions in most people.

The immune system makes protective proteins called antibodies that attack invaders such as germs.

Coming into contact with the allergen causes an immune system reaction that can inflame the skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.",What are allergies?,"[""Use less than 30 words.""]"

11,1,Mistral 7B,"The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens. When functioning properly, it identifies a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, distinguishing them from the body's own healthy tissues. The immune system has two main components: the innate immune system, which provides immediate but non-specific defense, and the adaptive immune system, which develops targeted responses to specific pathogens and creates immunological memory. Vaccination works by stimulating this adaptive immune system. A vaccine introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a protein or a piece of its genetic material, which triggers the production of antibodies and memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body long after the threat has been eliminated, providing rapid protection if the pathogen is encountered again. This process is called immunological memory and is the basis for how vaccines provide long-term protection against diseases. Modern vaccines have led to the eradication of smallpox and near-elimination of diseases like polio and measles in many parts of the world. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant public health challenge, with misinformation about vaccine safety contributing to decreased immunization rates in some communities.",How does vaccination provide immunity?,"[""Explain using a food analogy."", ""Ensure the response includes both technical terms and simple explanations."", ""Maintain a reassuring and professional tone throughout.""]"
